[{"header": "treasury and labor departments award funding for the first social impact partnership project", "date": "2021-03-22t17:30:04z", "text": "washington -- today, the u.s. department of the treasury and the u.s. department of labor are awarding the new york state energy research and development authority (nyserda) with up to $8.2 million for its project to provide clean energy job training to unemployed and low-wage workers, increase participants\u2019 wages, and to evaluate the training\u2019s effectiveness. this marks the first time that the treasury department has awarded funding through the social impact partnership to pay for results act (sippra) program. \n\n \u201camerica is facing profound economic and climate crises. we\u2019re still down nearly 10 million jobs from our pre-pandemic peak, and in addition, we\u2019re living in a narrow window in which we can still avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change,\u201d said treasury secretary janet l. yellen. \u201cthe president has called on us to \u2018seize the opportunity that climate change presents,\u2019 and that\u2019s what this grant does: it shows we can help workers and transition to a net-zero economy at the same time.\u201d \n\n the sippra program makes funding available to state and local governments for pay-for-results social impact partnership projects. sippra projects may seek to improve a variety of social problems, including increasing employment, wages, and financial stability for low-income families; improving family health and housing; and reducing recidivism. \n\n nyserda will train individuals who are long-term unemployed, low-wage workers, and youth ages 16-24 for energy efficiency occupations. the authority will receive up to $7.1 million if its clean energy jobs training program increases the participants\u2019 wages. nyserda will receive an additional $1.1 million to pay for the costs of independently evaluating the project. a key component of sippra is that projects must produce measurable outcomes before the federal government is required to make an award payment. similar sector-based training approaches have been shown to improve employment, earnings, and wage rates over a two-year period. \n\n acting president and ceo of nyserda doreen m. harris said, \u201cnyserda is thrilled to partner with the u.s. treasury department, the u.s. department of labor, and social finance on the first pay for success model in the country that directly supports essential clean energy workforce training. as new york state works to achieve its ambitious clean energy goals, we are diligently working to eliminate barriers to accessing quality jobs within the clean energy sector, especially within disadvantaged communities, and this new approach will drive the necessary scale-up of new york\u2019s clean energy workforce as we transition to a green economy.\u201d \n\n sippra funding is awarded through a competitive process. the treasury department selected nyserda\u2019s project based on the strength of its application, input from the commission on social impact partnerships, and in consultation with the federal interagency council on social impact partnerships. \n\n more information about sippra \n\n ###", "summary": "nyserda will provide clean energy job training to unemployed and low-wage workers. the authority will

services, u.s. house of representatives", "date": "2021-03-24t00:49:37z", "text": "chairwoman waters, ranking member mchenry, members of the committee, thank you for having me. \n\n we are meeting at a hopeful moment for the economy \u2013 but still a daunting one. while we\u2019re seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we\u2019re digging out of: the country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak. \n\n when congress passed the cares and consolidated appropriations acts last year, it gave the federal government some powerful tools to address the crisis. but upon taking office, i worried they weren\u2019t powerful enough. after all, there were \u2013 and still are \u2013 some very deep pockets of pain in the data. \n\n one-in-ten homeowners with a mortgage are behind on their payments, and almost one-in-five renters are behind on their rent. there are 22 million people who say they don\u2019t have enough food to eat. one-in-ten adults are hungry in america. \n\n i looked at data like these, and i worried that the covid economy was going to keep hurting millions of people now and haunt them long after the health emergency was over. \n\n we know that when the foundations of someone\u2019s life fall apart \u2013 when they lose the roof over their head or the ability to eat dinner every night \u2013 the pain can weigh on them for years. their earning potential is permanently lowered.\u00a0 i worried about this happening on a mass scale. \n\n that\u2019s why i advocated very hard for the american rescue plan, and it\u2019s why my first \u2013 and most enthusiastic \u2013 message today is: thank you. \n\n with the passage of the rescue plan, i am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact. and i believe they will be met there by a growing economy. in fact, i think we may see a return to full employment next year. \n\n of course, the speed and strength of our recovery depends, in part, on how we implement the legislation. treasury is tasked with much of that work, and there is nothing that i \u2013 or my team \u2013 take more seriously. we appreciate your oversight on this matter, and i want to briefly tell you about how we\u2019ve been working. \u00a0 \n\n since taking office two months ago, we have been expediting relief to the areas of greatest need. for example, small businesses \u2013 and especially the smallest small businesses, which are disproportionally owned by women and people of color. \n\n the pandemic has hit these businesses hard. the paycheck protection program was an early lifeline, but because of issues with the program\u2019s design, the first rounds often didn\u2019t reach the smallest sole proprietorships. we\u2019re addressing that now. we worked with sba to tweak how the program was implemented. it\u2019s allowing the ppp to reach millions more microbusinesses and entrepreneurs, especially in rural and low-income areas. \n\n we\u2019re also building capacity to support these communities over the longer term. because of the december legislation, treasury now has $12 billion to inject into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. in turn, these cdfis and mdis can lend that capital out, helping people buy homes and start businesses in places that the financial services sector traditionally hasn\u2019t served well. \u00a0 \n\n then, there are the families i spoke about, the ones struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table. \n\n the american rescue plan provides more than $30 billion to help renters and homeowners at risk of losing their homes. and we\u2019re making sure that assistance flows as efficiently as possible. \n\n for instance, the previous administration put in place rules that required tenants and landlords to provide quite a bit of documentation to get rental assistance, including detailed statements about their income. but some people don\u2019t have access to those documents. we\u2019re cutting through the red tape for them, while still taking reasonable steps to prevent fraud and abuse. \n\n and of course, we\u2019ve been sending direct payments to americans \u2013 a lot of americans. as of last week, we had issued over 90 million payments.\u00a0 \n\n and all this is just a fraction of treasury\u2019s work. there are so many more relief programs, including one that will provide $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. implementing all of it is more complicated than it sounds, and we are working closely with stakeholders to make sure that these programs are both efficient and effective. \n\n behind these many relief programs, these millions of transactions, are a staff of very dedicated (and very tired) treasury and irs employees. my final word is to them: thank you. you are putting on a master class in how government should work in the furnace of a crisis. i\u2019m grateful to be your colleague. \n\n with that, i am happy to answer any questions you have.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n view: secretary yellen's cares oversight hearing --written

analysis, before the senate committee on finance", "date": "2021-03-25t13:30:00z", "text": "chairman wyden, ranking member crapo, members of the committee: thank you for inviting me to share these views on the international aspects of business tax reform. international tax reform feeds into our most important tax policy goals: building a tax system that is fit for purpose, fair, and focused on the needs of all americans.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n in my testimony today, i will discuss several crucial issues related to international tax reform. first, we need better protections to defend the u.s. corporate tax base from the tax-motivated shifting of corporate profits to offshore havens. second, international tax reform is an essential ingredient in building a fairer tax system. third, it is important to modernize our tax system to better suit a globally integrated economy, reducing the tax preference in favor of foreign operations, and enabling u.s. workers to compete on a level playing field. most important, all our tax system choices must serve the interests of all americans. \n\n fortunately, there are relatively straightforward changes that we can make, that will vastly improve our international tax regime. these include a stronger, more robust minimum tax and steadfast work with our partners and allies abroad in order to counter the pressures of international tax competition. \n\n building a tax system that is fit for purpose \n\n international tax reform is essential to our most important tax policy goals. after the tax cuts of prior years, we now raise only about 16 percent of gdp in federal tax revenue. (to put this into perspective, the last time the u.s. balanced the federal budget, receipts were about 20 percent of gdp.) and, while the pandemic necessitated a large and robust fiscal response in the near term, it will be important to build a tax system that can contribute to our many important fiscal priorities, including lasting investments in infrastructure, research, and clean energy. at the same time, it is essential not to raise taxes on typical workers, who have often not felt the beneficial effects of our strong economic growth. \n\n compared to our trading partners, the u.s. government raises very little corporate tax revenue. for many years, the typical oecd (organization for economic cooperation and development) country has raised about 3 percent of gdp from corporate taxation, whereas in 2018 and 2019 (before the pandemic occurred), the united states raised only 1 percent of gdp from the corporate tax. even before the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, the united states was below peer nations, collecting only 2 percent of gdp. indeed, corporate taxes as a percentage of gdp have been trending downwards in the united states since the 1950s. [1] \n\n corporate tax revenues relative to gdp \n\n \n\t\t\t \u00a0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t united states \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t oecd average [2] \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t post tcja: 2018/2019 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 1.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 3.1 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t 5 years pre tcja: 2013-2017 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 2.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 2.9 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t years prior: 2000-2012 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 2.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 3.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t data source: oecd revenue statistics \n\n corporate tax revenues are low despite the fact that u.s. companies produce very high corporate profits, both in historic and comparative terms. for example, in recent years, corporate profits (after-tax) as a share of gdp averaged 9.7 percent (2005-2019), whereas in the period 1980-2000, corporate profits averaged only 5.4 percent of gdp. [3] \n\n indeed, the u.s. corporate sector is the most successful in the world; the united states hosts 37\u00a0percent of the forbes global 2000 top companies\u2019 profits, despite the fact that the united states only comprises 24 percent of world gdp and less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. [4] \n\n yet, despite the enormous success of the corporate sector, u.s. companies continue to shift corporate profits offshore, reducing the u.s. corporate tax base and u.s. tax revenues. as of 2017, corporate profit shifting by both u.s. and foreign multinational companies cost the u.s. government approximately $100 billion per year at prior tax rates. [5]  although revenue loss is mechanically lower at today\u2019s lower corporate income tax rates, recent data indicate that the role of foreign tax havens was quite similar in 2018 and 2019 as it was in the years before the 2017 law. \n\n although the 2017 law contained two modest measures that were supposed to reduce profit shifting (the gilti minimum tax, for global intangible low-tax income, and the beat, for base-erosion anti-abuse tax), the 2017 law also encouraged profit shifting in other ways, by exempting from u.s. taxation the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and by taxing foreign profits at half the rate of u.s. profits. \n\n the share of u.s. multinational corporation income in seven big havens, 2000-2019 \n\n \n\n note: data are foreign investment earnings data from the u.s. bureau of economic analysis. the seven low-tax jurisdictions that are particularly important in these data are: bermuda, the caymans, ireland, luxembourg, the netherlands, singapore, and switzerland. the haven share is mechanically higher than it would be in some data sources since the data are reported on an after-tax basis. \n\n based on the early evidence in the two years after the law, the use of tax havens to avoid tax continues unabated. as the figure above illustrates, the share of total foreign income in seven prominent tax havens is nearly identical in the two years after the law (2018 and 2019) as it was in the five year prior to the law, at 61 percent of after-tax income, or 1.5 percent of gdp. \n\n building a fairer tax system \n\n improving international taxation will do more than raise much-needed revenue. it will also improve the progressivity of our tax system, ensuring that large corporations\u2014and those that own them\u2014pay their fair share. \n\n the corporate tax is one of the most progressive taxes in our tax system, far more progressive than the individual income tax or the payroll tax. economic models from organizations as varied as the u.s. treasury, the joint committee on taxation, the congressional budget office, the tax policy center, and the american enterprise institute all agree that the vast majority of the corporate tax burden falls on the owners of capital and those with excess profits. \n\n recent decades have witnessed a worrisome increase in economic inequality, combined with a falling labor share of income. at the same time, governments throughout the world have too often responded by shifting relative burdens away from capital, reducing tax rates on capital gains, dividends, and corporate income, while increasing relative tax burdens on other income. instead of dampening economic inequality, the tax system has too often exacerbated it. in part, these policy changes may have been a response to the fact that capital is more mobile than labor, as it is easier to offshore a factory (and even easier to offshore paper profits) than it is to move a person (or their labor income). \n\n yet policy-makers have not sufficiently modernized the tax system to make it more suited to these global forces. the changes outlined below will go much further toward that end. it is also essential to remember that shifting the capital tax burden to individuals, rather than businesses, will still leave much capital income untaxed, unless long held tax preferences are completely rethought. at present, about 70 percent of u.s. equity income goes untaxed by the u.s. government at the individual level. [6]  (indeed, some u.s. equities are also held by foreigners, whose residence countries may or may not tax that income at home. when corporate rates are cut, large benefits accrue to foreign investors.) \n\n in addition to enhancing the progressivity of the u.s. tax system, the corporate tax is also efficient, since taxing excess profits can generate revenue without undue distortion, and evidence indicates that a rising share of the tax base, now likely over three quarters, is comprised of excess returns. [7]  finally, a majority of voters in both parties favor higher taxes on corporations. [8] \n\n building an economy that meets the needs of all americans \n\n our modern global economy generates enormous churn. forces such as transformative technological change, rising market power, import competition, declining unionization, and changing social norms have left many workers with economic outcomes that fall short of long-held expectations. nearly 90 percent of children born in the 1940s out-earned their parents, but that share has fallen steadily. for children born in 1970, only 60 percent out-earn their parents; for those born in the 1980s, only half do. [9] \n\n those left behind by economic disruption are looking for answers. some policy solutions, such as reinvigorating labor law to give workers greater economic power and investing in infrastructure and community colleges in left-behind regions, can be quite helpful. others, such as erecting immigration barriers, risk adding insult to injury. immigration is a vital source of job creation and innovation in the u.s. economy; turning our back on immigrants and foreign students weakens one of our most essential advantages. [10] \n\n yet we can do a lot more to ensure our tax system works for american workers. expanding the earned income tax credit rewards work for those that are struggling, and expanding the child tax credit is an enormous anti-poverty tool. both of these were enacted as part of the american rescue plan. in corporate tax, it is important to reduce the large tilt in the playing field that favors foreign income and to work with partner countries to lessen the pressures of tax competition. a stronger minimum tax, stronger measures to tackle the profit shifting of foreign multinational companies, and close cooperation with our allies all have an important role to play. \n\n building a 21st century tax system \n\n the american rescue plan provided an essential down payment, expanding child tax credits and earned income tax credits, both measures that go to the heart of creating inclusive, worker-focused prosperity. but we also need to build business tax systems that can handle the global mobility of capital. \n\n multinational corporations can reasonably be asked to pay their fair share. at present, u.s. corporations pay income tax at only a 21 percent rate, a lower marginal tax rate than that faced by many schoolteachers and firefighters. [11]  multinational companies operating offshore receive even more favorable tax treatment. under the gilti minimum tax, the first ten percent return on tangible assets is completely free of u.s. tax, and subsequent income is taxed with a 50 percent deduction, facing tax at approximately half the full u.s. rate. [12]  our tax system would benefit from a much stronger minimum tax. \n\n building multilateral cooperation in international tax \n\n we are not alone in worrying about the profit shifting of multinational companies. since 2013, there has been an ongoing international effort at cooperation in this area, led by the oecd and g20 countries, referred to as beps (for base erosion and profit shifting). the first round of negotiations made some modest progress in several areas, but ultimately was not transformational, as tax avoidance techniques that were shut down sprung back in different forms, and multinational company profit shifting continued in a manner similar to years prior. \n\n presently, a second round of negotiations is centered around addressing two problems: rethinking the allocation of taxing rights in a modern economy (so called \u201cpillar one\u201d), and ensuring that all companies pay some minimum level of tax (\u201cpillar two\u201d). within these efforts, a country-by-country minimum tax is presently being proposed internationally. \n\n in general, there is strong policy interest in solving these vexing international tax problems, and countries\u2019 efforts can be mutually reinforcing. for instance, governments levying minimum taxes generate positive fiscal spillovers for each other\u2019s tax bases, by substantially reducing the incentive of their resident multinational companies to shift profits away from all non-haven tax bases toward tax havens. further, u.s. leadership in international tax reform may incentivize stronger action abroad. \n\n working with our allies and friends in order to build better tax laws can help nations cooperate to solve other global collective action problems, not just stopping excessive tax competition pressures in corporate tax, but also using these vital international collaborations to work productively to handle issues like climate change, global public health, and other serious threats. \n\n building consensus \n\n several hurdles stand in the way of international reforms, but they are not insurmountable. \n\n concerns about the competitiveness of u.s. multinationals ignore the evidence. both before and after the 2017 tax act, u.s. multinational companies are the envy of the world, not just for their high profits and market capitalization, but also for their tax planning acumen. u.s. multinational companies paid similar effective tax rates as peers in other countries, even before the 2017 tax law dramatically lowered u.s. corporate tax rates. and, u.s. corporate tax revenues are far lower than those in peer countries, as shown in the table above. \n\n further, to the extent that foreign countries also adopt strong minimum taxes, that will also reduce any competitiveness worries, while protecting our tax base from the profit shifting of foreign multinational companies. in fact, the present moment is an ideal time to reform our international tax rules, since there is a strong international consensus around addressing these problems, and our action can encourage action abroad. \n\n finally, it is important to remember that competitiveness is about more than the success of u.s. companies in foreign merger and acquisition bids. it is also about ensuring that our tax code doesn\u2019t incentivize foreign operations at the expense of those at home. and, it is about nurturing the many fundamental strengths that make the united states a good place to do business. investing in our institutions, in the abilities, education, and economic power of american workers, in the quality of our infrastructure, and in cutting-edge research is all important. it is also important to work harmoniously with other countries in order to ensure a smooth and stable trading system, and in order to seriously address common concerns such as climate change and public health.\u00a0 \n\n \u00a0\n [1]  data from tax policy center. \u201ccorporate income tax as a

daunting one. while we\u2019re seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we\u2019re digging out of: the country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak. \n\n when congress passed the cares and consolidated appropriations acts last year, it gave the federal government some powerful tools to address the crisis. but upon taking office, i worried they weren\u2019t powerful enough. after all, there were \u2013 and still are \u2013 some very deep pockets of pain in the data. \n\n one-in-ten homeowners with a mortgage are behind on their payments, and almost one-in-five renters are behind on their rent. there are 22 million people who say they don\u2019t have enough food to eat. one-in-ten adults are hungry in america. \n\n i looked at data like these, and i worried that the covid economy was going to keep hurting millions of people now and haunt them long after the health emergency was over. \n\n we know that when the foundations of someone\u2019s life fall apart \u2013 when they lose the roof over their head or the ability to eat dinner every night \u2013 the pain can weigh on them for years. their earning potential is permanently lowered. \u00a0i worried about this happening on a mass scale. \n\n that\u2019s why i advocated very hard for the american rescue plan, and it\u2019s why my first \u2013 and most enthusiastic \u2013 message today is: thank you. \n\n with the passage of the rescue plan, i am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact. and i believe they will be met there by a growing economy. in fact, i think we may see a return to full employment next year. \n\n of course, the speed and strength of our recovery depends, in part, on how we implement the legislation. treasury is tasked with much of that work, and there is nothing that i \u2013 or my team \u2013 take more seriously. we appreciate your oversight on this matter, and i want to briefly tell you about how we\u2019ve been working. \u00a0 \n\n since taking office two months ago, we have been expediting relief to the areas of greatest need. for example, small businesses \u2013 and especially the smallest small businesses, which are disproportionally owned by women and people of color. \n\n the pandemic has hit these businesses hard. the paycheck protection program was an early lifeline, but because of issues with the program\u2019s design, the first rounds often didn\u2019t reach the smallest sole proprietorships. we\u2019re addressing that now. we worked with sba to tweak how the program was implemented. it\u2019s allowing the ppp to reach millions more microbusinesses and entrepreneurs, especially in rural and low-income areas. \n\n we\u2019re also building capacity to support these communities over the longer term. because of the december legislation, treasury now has $12 billion to inject into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. in turn, these cdfis and mdis can lend that capital out, helping people buy homes and start businesses in places that the financial services sector traditionally hasn\u2019t served well. \u00a0 \n\n then, there are the families i spoke about, the ones struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table. \n\n the american rescue plan provides more than $30 billion to help renters and homeowners at risk of losing their homes. and we\u2019re making sure that assistance flows as efficiently as possible. \n\n for instance, the previous administration put in place rules that required tenants and landlords to provide quite a bit of documentation to get rental assistance, including detailed statements about their income. but some people don\u2019t have access to those documents. we\u2019re cutting through the red tape for them, while still taking reasonable steps to prevent fraud and abuse. \n\n and of course, we\u2019ve been sending direct payments to americans \u2013 a lot of americans. as of last week, we had issued over 90 million payments.\u00a0 \n\n and all this is just a fraction of treasury\u2019s work. there are so many more relief programs, including one that will provide $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. implementing all of it is more complicated than it sounds, and we are working closely with stakeholders to make sure that these programs are both efficient and effective. \n\n behind these many relief programs, these millions of transactions, are a staff of very dedicated (and very tired) treasury and irs employees. my final word is to them: thank you. you are putting on a master class in how government should work in the furnace of a crisis. i\u2019m grateful to be your colleague. \n\n with that, i am happy to answer any questions you have. \n\n view: yellen sbhc oversight hearing written testimony & addendum", "summary": "the country is still down nearly 10 million

payments, the payments announced today primarily were sent to eligible taxpayers who filed 2019 or 2020 returns. people who don\u2019t typically file a return but who successfully used the non-filers tool on irs.gov last year were sent payments in this batch. \n\t in total, this second batch includes approximately 37 million payments, with a total value of nearly $83 billion. \n\t as part of that,

paper checks (with a total value of nearly $34 billion) and approximately 5 million prepaid debit cards (with a total value of around $11 billion). \n\t paper checks and debit cards \u2013 known as eip cards \u2013began processing on friday, march 19, and will continue to be sent by mail over the next few weeks. as  announced  last week, the first batch of payments was mostly sent by direct

included approximately 90 million payments, with a total value of more than $242 billion. \n\t the use of direct deposit to issue these payments means that they were disbursed remarkably faster than would otherwise be possible. \n\t while most payments were disbursed by direct deposit, treasury mailed roughly 150,000 checks worth approximately $442 million. additional batches of payments will be sent in the coming weeks as direct deposits and through the mail as paper checks or debit cards. the vast majority of all economic impact payments will be issued by direct deposit. no action is needed by most taxpayers. \n\n many federal beneficiaries who filed 2019 or 2020 returns or used the non-filers tool were included in these first two batches of payments, if eligible. for federal beneficiaries who did not file a 2019 or 2020 tax return or did not use the non-filers tool, the irs is working directly with the social security administration, the railroad retirement board, and the

rescue plan act (the \"act\"), which provides funds to states, territories, tribal governments, and localities to help them manage the economic consequences of covid-19.\u00a0 \n\n in the act, congress has provided funding to help states manage the public health and economic consequences of covid-19 and it has given states considerable flexibility to use that money to address the diverse needs of their communities. at the same time, congress placed limitations to ensure that the money is used to achieve those purposes - including provisions stating that this funding may not be used to offset a reduction in net tax revenue resulting from certain changes in state law.\u00a0 \n\n it is well established that congress may place such reasonable conditions on how states may use federal funding. congress includes those sorts of reasonable funding conditions in legislation routinely, including with respect to funding for medicaid, education, and highways. here, the act provides a broad outlay of federal funds, and accordingly includes restrictions to ensure that those funds are properly applied. earlier covid-19 relief measures providing state funding also included restrictions that barred states from spending those funds on certain ineligible expenditures.\u00a0 \n\n nothing in the act prevents states from enacting a broad variety of tax cuts. that is, the act does not \"deny states the ability to cut taxes in any manner whatsoever.\" it simply provides that funding received under the act may not be used to offset a reduction in net tax revenue resulting from certain changes in state law. if states lower certain taxes but do not use funds under the act to offset those cuts-for example, by replacing the lost revenue through other means-the limitation in the act is not implicated.\u00a0 \n\n it is also important to note that states choosing to use the federal funds to offset a reduction in net tax revenue do not thereby forfeit their entire allocation of funds appropriated under this statute. the limitation affects states' ability to retain only those federal funds used to offset a reduction in net tax revenue resulting from certain changes in state law.\u00a0 \n\n treasury is crafting further guidance-including guidance to address more specifically the issues raised by your letter and the procedures treasury will use for any future recoupment-that will provide additional information about how this provision will be administered. we will provide this guidance before a state must submit a certification under \u00a7 602( d)(l ). we also expect to engage in an ongoing dialogue throughout the program.\u00a0 \n\n these funds will provide transformative relief to states, territories, and tribal governments, and our communities should be able to use the funds to recover from the economic fallout due to the pandemic, which is what congress intended. i hope to work with your state, as well as others across the country, to ensure these funds can be used in ways that align with the goals of the statute without undue restrictions. \n\n sincerely, \n\n janet l. yellen \n\n cc: \nthe honorable christopher m.
