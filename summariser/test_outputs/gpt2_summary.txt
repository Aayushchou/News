In the first action, which we took last summer against Commerzbank AG’s London branch, we imposed a fine of £37.8 million. Commerzbank London provided products and 
transaction platforms for many of the bank’s global customers. At this point the bank had only three staff engaged in this task. Goldman Sachs was the primary 
booking entity for these transactions which were negotiated by a deal team based in Asia. The risk of the third party’s involvement was not even raised in the 
documentation that went before the committees approving the 1MDB Transactions. Record-keeping is a vitally important part of effective governance. There is a 
version of this in relation to systems and controls, especially if they become a bureaucratic insulation, attenuating the system from the gritty reality of the 
predicate criminality that needs to be inhibited. And, for the purposes of AML controls, the risks are not limited to white collar crime, extending to the proceeds 
of all criminal proceeds, from drug trafficking to terrorist financing. These are often complex investigations because they are rarely transactional; they require a 
systemic understanding of how a firm operates, its governance controls, its cultural habits – all of which can generate terabytes of data and information - as well 
as the nuts and bolts of sometimes opaque systems. A number of these sites are under investigation or have become the subject of proceedings. We would like to see 
the Unregistered Cryptocurrency Businesses List used in the same way as the Warning List, to safeguard consumers, as well as to ensure any transactions or transfers 
of funds by or to such firms are properly scrutinised and, where applicable, the subject of suspicious activity reports or other reports to the NCA and the FCA.
