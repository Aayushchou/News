In the first action, which we took last summer against Commerzbank AG’s London branch, we imposed a fine of £37.8 million. In October 2016, 1,720 new clients were in a 'huge backlog' awaiting to be onboarded. At this point the bank had only three staff engaged in this task. The catalogue of failures meant investment in systems and controls was wasted on measures that were unable to function as they had been designed or purposed. The risk of the third party’s involvement was not even raised in the documentation that went before the committees approving the 1MDB Transactions. A significant failure in this case involved the absence of proper record keeping of the identification, management and assessment of the substantial and evident risks involved in the transaction. Record-keeping is a vitally important part of effective governance. There is a version of this in relation to systems and controls, especially if they become a bureaucratic insulation, attenuating the system from the gritty reality of the predicate criminality that needs to be inhibited. On one hand, effective AML systems create a control environment that is able to identify valuable signals in complex data, with repeatable interrogations geared to specific and reasonably foreseeable crime risks, to ensure decision-making is calibrated to those risks and to record accurately how those risks have been addressed. On the other hand, systems can become overly complicated, bureaucratised, vulnerable to gaming by less scrupulous players, and expensive. The Warning List is designed to prevent consumers dealing with firms that appear they should be authorised by us but are not or falling for investment scams without undertaking proper checks.
