In the first action, which we took last summer against Commerzbank AG’s London branch, we imposed a fine of £37.8 million. At this point the bank had only three staff engaged in this task. These failings contributed to additional problems because automated systems lacked up to date information which in turn meant they became less reliable and effective. Goldman Sachs was the primary booking entity for these transactions which were negotiated by a deal team based in Asia. They involved jurisdictions which Goldman Sachs already considered had high risks. This meant significant reputational and financial crime risks were effectively ignored or censored from the approval process. These cases demonstrate both the value and challenge of systems and controls. We have also issued alerts on our Warning List concerning well over 1,000 firms, an increase of over 100% on 2019. We would like to see the Unregistered Cryptocurrency Businesses List used in the same way as the Warning List, to safeguard consumers, as well as to ensure any transactions or transfers of funds by or to such firms are properly scrutinised and, where applicable, the subject of suspicious activity reports or other reports to the NCA and the FCA. We know much of the industry is devoted to strong systems and controls in relation to AML. Indeed, the aim of AML regulation is not to catch anyone out but to set high standards of probity and scrutiny to inhibit illicit money flows in the financial system and to encourage participants in the system to behave as custodians and guardians of the public interest in preventing money laundering.
