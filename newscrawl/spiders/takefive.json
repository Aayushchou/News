to earn easy money during the pandemic, by posting fake adverts on jobs websites and social media. figures reveal there were over 17,000 suspected money mule cases involving 21-30 year olds in 2020, up five per cent on the previous year. the public is being urged to be wary of any offers of earning quick and easy cash online. money muling could lead to a criminal record, the closure of your bank account and difficulty getting a mobile phone contract. cash laundered by money mules is used by criminals to facilitate serious crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and people smuggling. young people whose job prospects have been impacted by the pandemic are being targeted online by criminals looking to recruit money mules to launder the profits of their crimes, uk finance and cifas have warned. the latest research from cifas has revealed there were 17,157 cases of suspected money muling activity involving 21-30 year olds in 2020, a five per cent increase on the previous year. this age group accounted for 42 per cent of money mule activity in 2020, up from 38 per cent three years ago. it was among the hardest hit by the economic impact of covid-19, with thousands facing job losses as a result of the pandemic and graduates entering the jobs market at a time of unprecedented uncertainty. intelligence suggests criminals are exploiting people\u2019s financial difficulties by using social media platforms, jobs websites and phishing emails to approach them with offers of easy cash. they will use the promise of earning money quickly to convince individuals to provide their bank details, before asking them to transfer the funds received to another account and keep some of the cash for themselves, making them a money mule. often, people are unaware that allowing their bank accounts to be used in this way is a crime which will have long-term consequences when they are caught. this could include a criminal record, having their bank account closed and difficulty opening one elsewhere, and trouble obtaining mobile phone contracts or accessing credit in future. those who become money mules are also often not aware that the cash they are laundering is used by criminals to facilitate serious crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and people smuggling. the criminals will typically post adverts on legitimate jobs websites or social media, using terms such as \u201cmoney transfer agents\u201d or \u201clocal processors\u201d to recruit people to launder the profits of their crimes. they may also create profiles on social media platforms, infiltrate popular groups or special interest pages to seek out suitable targets, and post images showing off a luxury lifestyle \u2013 for example expensive cars or large quantities of cash \u2013 to entice young people. increasingly, money mule recruiters are making use of heavily encrypted instant messaging services to avoid detection. the figures also show there has been a marked drop in those aged below 21 being recruited as money mules in 2020, with cases falling by 12 per cent to 8,791. this may be due to lockdown restrictions which have\u00a0meant teenagers are spending longer amounts of time at home with their parents and have reduced opportunities for criminals to approach young people in person, for example outside schools and at universities. the overall number of suspected cases of money muling activity across all age groups fell slightly in 2020 from a peak the previous year, but remain 27 per cent higher than in 2017. uk finance and cifas are calling for fraud and economic crime to be included in the upcoming online safety bill. this would make online platforms responsible for taking down fraudulent content, including social media posts or job adverts used to recruit people as money mules. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, commented: \u201ccriminals are cruelly preying on \u2018generation covid\u2019 and those struggling to find work at this difficult time, by using fake job adverts online to recruit people as money mules.  \u201cwe would urge everyone to remain cautious about any offers of quick and easy money and remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. \u201cat the same time, online platforms must take swift action to detect and take down content being used to promote money muling activity. organised criminal gangs use money mules to launder the profits of their devastating crimes, including fraud, drugs smuggling and people trafficking. we all have a duty to stop them.\u201d mike haley, chief executive officer of cifas, said: \u201callowing your bank account to be used to transfer funds is illegal. although transferring funds doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s doing any harm, the money you\u2019re being asked to move often comes from scams and crimes committed against innocent members of the public.  \u201cwe\u2019re now seeing more variations of this type of activity including mules being asked to buy cryptocurrencies or gift cards to mask the stolen funds, making it even more difficult for organisations to trace this money and return it to victims.  \u201cbanks now have sophisticated technology to detect mule activity. when mules are caught, they can expect their bank accounts to be closed and face great difficulty in obtaining credit, mobile phones or loans in the future. it is vital that you keep your bank account to yourself and not be fooled into taking part in this illegal activity.\u201d uk finance and cifas are urging the public to stay safe by following the advice of the  don\u2019t be fooled  campaign: research any potential employer by conducting your own background checks and making sure their contact details are genuine. don\u2019t respond to adverts offering large sums of money for minimal effort. be wary of job ads that are written in poor english with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. don\u2019t give your bank account details to anyone unless you know and trust them. contact information uk finance press office 020 7416 6750 [email\u00a0protected] press team cifas 0203 004 3644 [email\u00a0protected] notes to editors 1. images

the first half of 2020 through the banking protocol, a scheme that alerts local police to suspected scams. the scheme has prevented victims from losing \u00a3116 million of fraud and led to 744 arrests since it was introduced three years ago. a range of scams that trick elderly and vulnerable customers into withdrawing cash from their branch have been prevented, including courier scams, romance fraud and rogue traders. customers helped through the initiative are typically aged 65 or above, with some over 100 years old. the banking protocol scheme is now being expanded to telephone and online banking. bank branch staff worked with the police to stop \u00a319 million of fraud in the first half of 2020 through the banking protocol, according to the latest figures from uk finance. 1 the banking protocol is a uk-wide scheme that enables bank branch staff to alert their local police force when they suspect a customer is being scammed. police will then visit the branch to investigate the suspected fraud and arrest any suspects still on the scene. \u00a319.3 million of fraud was prevented and over 100 arrests were made through the scheme between january and june 2020. the latest figures mean the scheme has prevented victims losing a total of \u00a3116 million of fraud and led to 744 arrests since it was first introduced three years ago by uk finance, national trading standards and local police forces. 2 the scheme is often used to prevent impersonation scams, in which criminals imitate police or bank staff and convince people to visit their bank and withdraw or transfer large sums of money. these can include courier scams, where those targeted are persuaded to take out a large sum of cash and hand it over to a fraudster posing as a courier. they can also include safe account scams, where the victims are told their money isn\u2019t safe in the account it\u2019s currently in and needs to be transferred to another account. the initiative has also been used to prevent romance fraud, in which fraudsters use fake online dating profiles to trick victims into transferring money, and to catch rogue traders who prey on the elderly by demanding cash for unnecessary work on their property. uk finance has today published top tips from the  take five to stop fraud  campaign on how to stay safe from these scam types. 4 branch staff are trained to spot the warning signs that suggest someone may have fallen for one of these scams and make an emergency call to the police. 3,250 calls have been made in the first six months of this year through the scheme, including 637 in june. data provided by police forces shows that customers helped through the banking protocol are typically aged over 65 while some were over 100 years old, demonstrating how these scams are often targeted towards the elderly and vulnerable. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime, uk finance, commented: \u201cit is sickening that criminals are preying on elderly and vulnerable victims during this difficult time. bank branch staff on the frontline are doing a heroic job in stopping these cruel scams and helping bring those responsible to justice. \u00a0 \u201c the banking industry is now working with police forces to expand this scheme to telephone and online banking, with a focus on protecting vulnerable customers.  \u00a0 \u201cit\u2019s vital that people always follow the advice of the  take five to stop fraud  campaign,  and remember that a bank or the police will never ask you to transfer funds to another account or to withdraw cash to hand over to them for safe-keeping.\u201d t/commander clinton blackburn, from the city of london police, the lead force for fraud, said: \u201cbanks are often the first point of contact when someone is about to fall victim to fraud, so the banking protocol is a vital way of protecting vulnerable victims and preventing criminals from taking advantage of them. \u201chaving a system in place where an immediate police response can be generated to a suspected fraud, allows officers to gain vital evidence and increases our chances of catching the criminal in person, or following the money trail right to their door.\u201d those assisted by the scheme are offered ongoing support to help prevent them falling victim to scams in future, including through referrals to social services, expert fraud prevention advice and additional checks on future transactions. in the first six months of this year, 1,149 potentially vulnerable adults were identified after bank branch staff alerted the police to suspected scams through the scheme. to build on the success of the scheme, discussions are currently underway with local police forces over expanding it to cover attempted bank transfers made by customers through telephone and online banking. this would enable bank staff at call centres to notify police when certain attempted bank transfers are being made which they believe may be the result of a scam, in situations where the customer is unable to visit their local branch to enable further checks. ends for more information please call the uk finance press office on 020 7416 6750 or

scams and \u00a321.2 million lost to scams impersonating other trusted organisations. scams involving the criminal impersonating a bank or the police often begin with a phone call or text message claiming there has been fraud on the victim\u2019s account. the customer is then convinced that to protect their money they must transfer it to a \u2018safe account\u2019 which actually belongs to the fraudster. other common scams involve text messages or emails claiming a victim must settle a fine, pay overdue tax or return a refund that was given by mistake. intelligence reported to uk finance suggests that the rise in impersonation scams is being partly driven by criminals exploiting covid-19. these scams include fraudsters sending emails or text messages pretending to be from government departments and offering grants related to covid-19. criminals may also get in touch claiming to be from an airline or travel agency, offering refunds for flights or holidays that have been cancelled due to the pandemic. additionally, criminals are exploiting the growing numbers of people working remotely, by posing as it departments or software providers and claiming that payments are needed to fix problems with people\u2019s internet connection or broadband or asking for remote access to the victim\u2019s computer. criminals will tend to research their targets first, using information gathered from other scams, social media and data breaches in order to make their approach sound genuine. they will also often try to rush or panic their potential victims into making a payment, for example by claiming their money is at risk or their account will be blocked unless they act. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, commented: \u201ccriminal gangs are ruthlessly exploiting this pandemic to commit fraud, so it\u2019s vital we all work together to beat them. \u00a0 \u201cwe are urging the public to remain vigilant against these vile scams and remember that criminals are experts at impersonating people, organisations and the police. fraudsters  will spend hours researching their victims, but they only need you to let your guard down for a minute. \u00a0 \u201calways take a moment to stop and think if you receive a request to make a payment from someone claiming to be from an organisation you trust. instead, contact the company or organisation directly using a known email or phone number, like the one on their official website.\u201d the banking and finance industry has put in place a range of measures to combat impersonation scams. 1  this includes the  banking protocol , a scheme that allows bank branch staff to alert police to suspected scams and which prevented \u00a319 million of fraud and led to over 100 arrests in

greater consistency for customers. losses to unauthorised fraud fell by eight per cent in the first half of this year to \u00a3374.3 million, figures from uk finance\u2019s half-year fraud report 1  for 2020 have revealed.\u00a0 the banking and finance industry prevented \u00a3853 million of attempted unauthorised fraud over the same period, up four per cent on the previous year, as firms continue to invest in advanced security systems 2  to detect and block fraudulent activity. it means that almost \u00a37 in every \u00a310 of attempted fraud was blocked in the first half of this year. uk finance is warning that criminals have been exploiting and adapting to covid-19 with a growth in fraud and scams that target people online. many of these scams harvest customers\u2019 personal and financial details, for example through phishing emails or smishing text messages impersonating trusted organisations. there is often a delay between criminals obtaining people\u2019s details and using them to commit fraud, meaning the full losses from covid-19 related scams in the first half of this year are likely to not yet have been fully realised. customers are reminded to follow the advice of the  take five to stop fraud  campaign and always take a moment to stop and think before parting with their money or information in case it\u2019s a scam. the figures also suggest criminals have been turning away from more traditional forms of fraud due to the impact of the pandemic. contactless card fraud, which takes place using lost and stolen cards, fell by 20 per cent to \u00a38.2 million, the first year-on-year decrease since this data started being collected in 2013. this is likely to be related to the reduced number of face-to-face transactions by consumers using contactless cards during the lockdown. cheque fraud losses also saw a significant fall of 78 per cent to \u00a36.4 million, which is likely to have been driven by the reduced use of cheques during the lockdown period and the increased use of advanced security features on business cheques. \u00a3207.8 million was lost to authorised push payment (app) fraud in the first half of 2020, which takes place when a customer is tricked into making a payment to another account that is controlled by a criminal. this is in line with losses in the same period last year. banks and other finance providers were able to return \u00a373.1 million of the overall losses from app fraud to victims, an 86 per cent increase on the sum returned in the same period in 2019. losses to investment scams rose by 27 per cent to \u00a355.2 million in the first half of 2020, the largest increase of any scam type. app fraud continues to be driven by the abuse of online platforms, including investment scams promoted on search engines and social media, fake goods listed on auction websites and criminals posing as would-be partners on online dating platforms. uk finance is calling for fraud to be included in the scope of the government\u2019s new online harms regulatory framework, to help ensure that online platforms address vulnerabilities that are being exploited by criminals to commit fraud. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, said: \u201ccriminals have ruthlessly adapted to this pandemic with scams exploiting the rise in people working from home and spending time online.   these range from investment scams promoted on social media and search engines to the use of phishing emails and fake websites to harvest people\u2019s data. \u201cthe banking industry is working hard to protect customers from this threat, with almost \u00a37 in \u00a310 of fraud prevented in the first half of this year. but we need the public to remain vigilant against scams and remember that criminals are experts at exploiting events like covid-19 to impersonate trusted organisations. always take a moment to stop and think before parting with your money or information, and don\u2019t let a criminal rush or panic you into making a decision that you\u2019ll later come to regret.\u201d uk finance has also published separate figures for the second time on compensation for customers under the voluntary code on app fraud, introduced on 28 may 2019 following work between the banking industry, consumer groups and the payment systems regulator 3 . customers of a payment service provider that is signed up to the code are reimbursed if they fall victim to app fraud, provided they did everything expected of them under the code.\u00a0nine payment service providers, representing 19 consumer brands and over 85 per cent of authorised push payments, have signed up to the code so far. customers received \u00a347.9 million in compensation in cases assessed under the code in the first half of this year. this accounted for 38 per cent of the \u00a3126.5 million in losses in cases assessed under the code during this period. it means a total of \u00a389.2 million has been reimbursed to customers under the app voluntary code since it was launched on 28 may 2019. this figure does not include all money returned to app fraud victims in all cases,\u00a0for example in some instances where the customer was found at fault under the code but the bank was able to trace and return the original stolen funds. compensation rates were higher for more sophisticated scams and those involving higher, life-changing sums of money.\u00a0 54 per cent of losses were reimbursed under the code for scams in which criminals impersonate banks or the police, which saw an average loss per case of \u00a34,460. this compares to just 22 per cent of losses being reimbursed for purchase scams, where the customer pays in advance for goods or services that are never received, and which have an average loss per case of \u00a3720. uk finance is backing calls from consumer groups and mps for legislation to be introduced to put the voluntary code on a statutory footing. this would help ensure more consistent outcomes for customers and mean the code applies to firms across the banking and finance industry. the trade body is also calling on regulators and the government to deliver a long-term, sustainable funding arrangement for app cases where neither the customer nor the bank is at fault. katy worobec added: \u201cthe voluntary code, developed by the banking industry alongside consumer groups, has led to more victims being reimbursed particularly for higher value and more sophisticated scams. \u201chowever, it is now clear that the voluntary code is not delivering consistent outcomes and that new legislation is needed to deliver certainty for both firms and their customers. \u201cthis should go hand in hand with progress towards a sustainable funding solution for cases in which neither the customer or bank is at fault, and a stronger regulatory framework to ensure online platforms and other sectors play their part in tackling fraud.\u201d staying safe uk

service provider that is signed up to the code will be fully reimbursed if they fall victim to an app scam, provided they did everything expected of them under the code. nine payment service providers, representing 19 consumer brands and over 85 per cent of authorised push payments, have signed up to the code so far. a list of signatories can be found  here . in situations where both the customer and their payment service provider meet the required standards under the the code, a customer of a signatory firm who falls victim to an app scam will still receive their money back. to fund

banking. banks prevented \u00a3181.5 million of attempted unauthorised remote banking fraud in the first half of 2020, up 40 per cent on the same period the previous year. cheque fraud\u00a0losses fell by 78 per cent to \u00a36.4 million compared to the same period last year. intelligence suggests this fall was driven by the reduced use of cheques during the lockdown period as well as increased use of advanced security features on cheques to identify fraudulent ones as they go through the clearing process. over \u00a3184 million of attempted unauthorised cheque fraud was prevented, a fall of nine per cent compared to the first half of 2019. authorised push payment fraud authorised push payment (app) fraud occurs when a customer is duped into authorising a payment to another account which

period in 2019. investment scams, in which a criminal convinces their victim to move their money to a fictitious fund or to pay for a fake investment, saw the highest increase in losses of any scam type. \u00a355.2 million was lost to this type of fraud, an increase of 27 per cent compared to the same period last year. purchase scams, in which the victim pays in advance for goods or services that are never received, remained the most common form of app fraud in the first half of 2020. these scams accounted for 57 per cent of the total number of app fraud cases in the first half of 2020. the lower average case values mean that they accounted for just 13 per cent of the total value of app fraud in the same period. code \u00a0 under industry voluntary\u00a0 code  on app scams introduced

\u00a3126.5 million was lost to app fraud in cases assessed under the code during this period, of which \u00a347.9 million was reimbursed to victims (38 per cent of the total). this is a significant increase on the 19 per cent of app losses that were reimbursed before the code was introduced. in total 61,333 cases were assessed and closed under the code during this period. of these, 77 per cent involved values of less than \u00a31,000, whilst only 4 per cent of cases involved the more life-changing sums of \u00a310,000 plus. 40 per cent of losses were reimbursed in those cases involving values of \u00a310,000 or more, compared to 30 per cent of losses reimbursed for cases involving values of less than \u00a31,000. reimbursement levels were higher for more sophisticated scams in which criminals impersonate other organisations to target their victims. 54 per cent of losses were reimbursed for bank and police impersonation scams, the highest out of all eight scam types. for purchase scams, 22 per cent of all losses were reimbursed, the smallest proportion of across all eight scam types. these figures do not include all money returned to app fraud victims in all cases,\u00a0for example in some instances where the customer was found at fault under the code but the bank was able to trace and return the original stolen funds."},
{"header": "romance scams on the up during lockdown", "date": "10th february 2021", "text": "uk finance is today urging the public to be vigilant and look out for friends and family to help keep them safe from romance scams this valentine\u2019s day. new data from uk finance reveals a 20 per cent increase in bank transfer romance fraud between january and november 2020 compared to the previous year, with the total value of these scams rising by 12 per cent to \u00a318.5 million. the average loss per victim reported to uk finance members was \u00a37,850, highlighting the significant impact this type of fraud can have on victims\u2019 finances. but criminals can trick victims into sending them money in many ways, not just via a bank transfer. action fraud has also seen a rise in reports made by members of the public who have fallen victim to romance fraud in 2020, with total reported losses equating to over \u00a368 million. in these reports, victims have lost money via bank transfer, money transfer, sending fraudsters gift cards and vouchers or presents such as phones and laptops, and providing them with access to their bank account or card. romance scams involve people being duped into sending money to criminals who go to great lengths to gain their trust and convince them that they are in a genuine relationship. they use language to manipulate, persuade and exploit so that requests for money do not raise alarm bells. these requests might be highly emotive, such as criminals claiming they need money for emergency medical care, or to pay for transport costs to visit the victim if they are overseas. the rise in romance scams comes as more people have turned to online dating during 2020 due to social distancing restrictions. figures from the online dating association (oda) estimate that over 2.3 million brits used dating apps during the first lockdown, with 64 per cent of people surveyed seeing dating apps as a lifeline for those living alone. while the internet can be a great way to meet people and form new relationships, the growth in popularity of online dating is giving criminals more opportunities to exploit and coerce people into parting with their money. scammers will often build a relationship with their victims over time, the oda\u2019s data shows that half (53 per cent) of people surveyed are having longer conversations on dating services during lockdown. uk finance is therefore calling on people to look out for their friends and family this valentine\u2019s day. dating app users should also speak to their friends and family and follow the advice of the  take five to stop fraud  campaign to keep themselves safe from scams. \u25cf stop: taking a moment to stop and think before parting with your money or information could keep you safe. \n\u25cf challenge: could it be fake? it\u2019s ok to reject, refuse or ignore any requests. only criminals will try to rush or panic you. \n\u25cf protect: contact your bank immediately if you think you\u2019ve fallen for a scam and report it to action fraud. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, said: \u201cwith the rising use of online dating service users during lockdown, criminals are using clever tactics to exploit people who think they\u2019ve met their perfect partner online. \u201cromance scams can leave customers out of love and out of pocket, but there are steps people can take to keep themselves or their family and friends safe \u2013 both on and offline. people can help their loved ones spot the signs of a scam, particularly as romance scammers can be very convincing by forming an emotional attachment with their victims. \u201cthe banking and finance industry is working hard to protect customers from fraud, but everyone should remain vigilant to the risks of romance scams. if you suspect you\u2019ve been the victim of a scam, please contact your bank as soon as possible.\u201d george kidd, chief executive of the online dating association, said: \u201coda members work to keep users safe by using human and technology content moderation. many services allow daters to use \u201cselfies\u201d and video to assure others of their identity. the services offer messaging platforms which allow chat in a managed space. daters should make the most of this secure environment and remember the time online is the beginning of getting to know someone you have never met in person. you should never hesitate to report if someone asks you for money, even if they do this outside of the dating service.\u201d pauline smith, head of action fraud, said: \u201clast year, we sadly saw criminals exploit the coronavirus pandemic as a means to commit fraud, and romance fraud was no exception. the national lockdowns, and other restrictions on our social lives, implemented because of the coronavirus outbreak, have meant more people have been seeking companionship online and this has undoubtedly affected the number of reports we have seen. \u201cit\u2019s important to say that most online dating sites, social media sites and gaming apps are perfectly safe. however, any online platform that allows you to connect with and talk to other people could be targeted by romance fraudsters so it\u2019s important to remain vigilant. \u201cif you think you\u2019ve been a victim of romance fraud, please don\u2019t feel ashamed or embarrassed \u2013 you are not alone. anyone can fall victim to fraud, but it\u2019s important that contact your bank immediately and report it to action fraud.\u201d signs your friend or family member may be involved in a romance scam: \u2022 they may be very secretive about their relationship or provide excuses for why their online partner has not video called or met them in person. they might become hostile or angry, and withdraw from conversation when you ask any questions about their partner \n\u2022 they may express very strong emotions and commitment to someone they have only just met \n\u2022 they have sent, or are planning to send, money to someone they have not met face-to-face. they may take out loans or withdraw from their pension to send money. how users can stay safe from romance scams: \u2022 be suspicious of any requests for money from someone you have never met in person, particularly if you have only recently met online. \n\u2022 speak to your family or friends to get advice. \n\u2022 profile photos may not be genuine, do your research first. performing a reverse image search on a search engine can find photos that have been taken from somewhere, or someone, else. if you think you have been a victim of a romance scam, do not feel ashamed or embarrassed \u2013 you are not alone. contact your bank immediately and report it to action fraud on 0300 123 2040 or via actionfraud.police.uk. if you are in scotland, please report to police scotland directly by calling 101. no matter how long you\u2019ve been speaking to someone online and how much you think you trust them, if you have not met them in person it\u2019s important that you do not: \u2022 send them any money \n\u2022 allow them access to your bank account \n\u2022 transfer money on their behalf \n\u2022 take a loan out for them \n\u2022 provide copies of your personal documents such as passports or driving licenses \n\u2022 invest your own money on their behalf or on

been operational across all police forces of the uk since march 2018. 52 payment service providers, including all the main high street banks and the post office, are now fully signed up to the scheme and have trained their front-line branch staff in the steps that need to be taken when a customer is at risk. the banking protocol has been rolled out to include telephone and online banking, which has been particularly important for vulnerable customers who have been unable to visit their local branch as a result of the coronavirus lockdown restrictions. the banking and finance industry is currently working with police forces on the expansion of the scheme. please find more information  here case study a customer notified their bank that they believed themselves to be a victim of a romance scam, but later contacted their bank to withdraw the claim. the bank asked more questions which led them to believe that the customer was the victim of a romance scam and would continue to be victimised if they made additional payments to the account they had previously reported. the bank continued to engage with the customer, whilst also monitoring the customer\u2019s account. this showed that the customer was still trying to make payments to the suspected fraudster on numerous occasions but, despite the bank\u2019s interventions, they could not convince the customer of the scam. the bank, having exhausted all options, submitted a banking protocol email referral. local police went to the victim\u2019s house the same day, confirmed the bank\u2019s suspicions and provided victim care."}
