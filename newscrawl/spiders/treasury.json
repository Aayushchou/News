{"header": ["Treasury International Capital Data for January  "], "date": "2021-03-16T14:00:00Z", "text": "washington  \u2013 the u.s. department of the treasury today released treasury international capital (tic) data for january 2021.\u00a0 the next release, which will report on data for february 2021, is scheduled for april 15, 2021. \n\n the sum total in january of all net foreign acquisitions of long-term securities, short-term u.s. securities, and banking flows was a net tic inflow of $106.3 billion. \u00a0of this, net foreign private inflows were $45.0 billion, and net foreign official inflows were $61.3 billion. \n\n foreign residents increased their holdings of long-term u.s. securities in january; net purchases were $34.0 billion.\u00a0 net purchases by private foreign investors were $3.4 billion, while net purchases by foreign official institutions were $30.6 billion. \n\n u.s. residents decreased their holdings of long-term foreign securities, with net sales of $56.8 billion. \n\n taking into account transactions in both foreign and u.s. securities, net foreign purchases of long-term securities were $90.8 billion.\u00a0 after including adjustments, such as estimates of unrecorded principal payments to foreigners on u.s. asset-backed securities, overall net foreign purchases of long-term securities are estimated to have been $50.1 billion in january. \n\n foreign residents decreased their holdings of u.s. treasury bills by $12.2 billion.\u00a0 foreign resident holdings of all dollar-denominated short-term u.s. securities and other custody liabilities increased by $1.5 billion. \n\n banks\u2019 own net dollar-denominated liabilities to foreign residents increased by $54.7 billion. \n\n complete data are available on the treasury website at: \n\n www.treasury.gov/resource-center/data-chart-center/tic/pages/index.aspx \n\n about tic data \n\n the monthly data on holdings of long-term securities, as well as the monthly table on major foreign holders of treasury securities, reflect foreign holdings of u.s. securities collected primarily on the basis of custodial data.\u00a0 these data help provide a window into foreign ownership of u.s. securities, but they cannot attribute holdings of u.s. securities with complete accuracy.\u00a0 for example, if a u.s. treasury security purchased by a foreign resident is held in a custodial account in a third country, the true ownership of the security will not be reflected in the data.\u00a0 the custodial data will also not properly attribute u.s. treasury securities managed by foreign private portfolio managers who invest on behalf of residents of other countries.\u00a0 in addition, foreign countries may hold dollars and other u.s. assets that are not captured in the tic data.\u00a0 for these reasons, it is difficult to draw precise conclusions from tic data about changes in the foreign holdings of u.s. financial assets by individual countries. \n\n press notice tic

Yellen on the Passage of the American Rescue Plan"], "date": "2021-03-16T14:00:00Z", "text": "the numbers may not immediately reflect it, but today was a pivotal day for the american economy. \n\n from the time the pandemic began up until this very week, the economic data has contained deep pockets of pain. roughly 18 million people are still receiving unemployment insurance, and nearly one million of the families relying on it say their children don\u2019t have enough to eat.\u00a0 \n\n upon taking office, i worried that many of these families would be haunted by the covid economy long after the health emergency was over. we know that when the foundations of someone\u2019s life collapse \u2013 when they lose a small business, or the roof over their head, or the ability to eat dinner every night \u2013 it can scar them permanently; their ability to earn is forever lowered. i worried this would happen on a mass scale, but now i am confident that it won\u2019t. \n\n with the passage of the american rescue plan, i believe americans will emerge from the pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact. and that is an enormous economic and moral achievement for america. \n\n indeed, we are now charting a very different course out of this crisis compared to the one a decade ago. rather than a long, slow recovery, i expect we could reach full employment by as soon as next year. \n\n our treasury team will be doing everything we can to accelerate the recovery. we are ready to get to work implementing the measures in the rescue plan, including economic impact payments, expanded child tax credits, help for struggling renters and homeowners, and support for state, local and tribal governments. \n\n of course, there will still be tough months ahead, but eventually, this law will help clear away the immediate crisis in front of our eyes, and let us start building a better post-covid future. \n\n ###"}
