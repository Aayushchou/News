2020, as the banking industry prevented \u00a3853 million of losses. criminals are exploiting and adapting to covid-19 with a rise in online data harvesting and a fall in cheque and contactless card fraud. \u00a3207.8 million was lost to\u00a0authorised push payment (app) fraud, in line with the same period last year. finance providers were able to return \u00a373.1 million of app fraud losses to victims, up 86 per cent compared to last year. \u00a347.9 million of losses were reimbursed to victims under app voluntary code in first half of 2020. uk finance is calling for legislation to ensure greater consistency for customers. losses to unauthorised fraud fell by eight per cent in the first half of this year to \u00a3374.3 million, figures from uk finance\u2019s half-year fraud report 1  for 2020 have revealed.\u00a0 the banking and finance industry prevented \u00a3853 million of attempted unauthorised fraud over the same period, up four per cent on the previous year, as firms continue to invest in advanced security systems 2  to detect and block fraudulent activity. it means that almost \u00a37 in every \u00a310 of attempted fraud was blocked in the first half of this year. uk finance is warning that criminals have been exploiting and adapting to covid-19 with a growth in fraud and scams that target people online. many of these scams harvest customers\u2019 personal and financial details, for example through phishing emails or smishing text messages impersonating trusted organisations. there is often a delay between criminals obtaining people\u2019s details and using them to commit fraud, meaning the full losses from covid-19 related scams in the first half of this year are likely to not yet have been fully realised. customers are reminded to follow the advice of the  take five to stop fraud  campaign and always take a moment to stop and think before parting with their money or information in case it\u2019s a scam. the figures also suggest criminals have been turning away from more traditional forms of fraud due to the impact of the pandemic. contactless card fraud, which takes place using lost and stolen cards, fell by 20 per cent to \u00a38.2 million, the first year-on-year decrease since this data started being collected in 2013. this is likely to be related to the reduced number of face-to-face transactions by consumers using contactless cards during the lockdown. cheque fraud losses also saw a significant fall of 78 per cent to \u00a36.4 million, which is likely to have been driven by the reduced use of cheques during the lockdown period and the increased use of advanced security features on business cheques. \u00a3207.8 million was lost to authorised push payment (app) fraud in the first half of 2020, which takes place when a customer is tricked into making a payment to another account that is controlled by a criminal. this is in line with losses in the same period last year. banks and other finance providers were able to return \u00a373.1 million of the overall losses from app fraud to victims, an 86 per cent increase on the sum returned in the same period in 2019. losses to investment scams rose by 27 per cent to \u00a355.2 million in the first half of 2020, the largest increase of any scam type. app fraud continues to be driven by the abuse of online platforms, including investment scams promoted on search engines and social media, fake goods listed on auction websites and criminals posing as would-be partners on online dating platforms. uk finance is calling for fraud to be included in the scope of the government\u2019s new online harms regulatory framework, to help ensure that online platforms address vulnerabilities that are being exploited by criminals to commit fraud. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, said: \u201ccriminals have ruthlessly adapted to this pandemic with scams exploiting the rise in people working from home and spending time online.   these range from investment scams promoted on social media and search engines to the use of phishing emails and fake websites to harvest people\u2019s data. \u201cthe banking industry is working hard to protect customers from this threat, with almost \u00a37 in \u00a310 of fraud prevented in the first half of this year. but we need the public to remain vigilant against scams and remember that criminals are experts at exploiting events like covid-19 to impersonate trusted organisations. always take a moment to stop and think before parting with your money or information, and don\u2019t let a criminal rush or panic you into making a decision that you\u2019ll later come to regret.\u201d uk finance has also published separate figures for the second time on compensation for customers under the voluntary code on app fraud, introduced on 28 may 2019 following work between the banking industry, consumer groups and the payment systems regulator 3 . customers of a payment service provider that is signed up to the code are reimbursed if they fall victim to app fraud, provided they did everything expected of them under the code.\u00a0nine payment service providers, representing 19 consumer brands and over 85 per cent of authorised push payments, have signed up to the code so far. customers received \u00a347.9 million in compensation in cases assessed under the code in the first half of this year. this accounted for 38 per cent of the \u00a3126.5 million in losses in cases assessed under the code during this period. it means a total of \u00a389.2 million has been reimbursed to customers under the app voluntary code since it was launched on 28 may 2019. this figure does not include all money returned to app fraud victims in all cases,\u00a0for example in some instances where the customer was found at fault under the code but the bank was able to trace and return the original stolen funds. compensation rates were higher for more sophisticated scams and those involving higher, life-changing sums of money.\u00a0 54 per cent of losses were reimbursed under the code for scams in which criminals impersonate banks or the police, which saw an average loss per case of \u00a34,460. this compares to just 22 per cent of losses being reimbursed for purchase scams, where the customer pays in advance for goods or services that are never received, and which have an average loss per case of \u00a3720. uk finance is backing calls from consumer groups and mps for legislation to be introduced to put the voluntary code on a statutory footing. this would help ensure more consistent outcomes for customers and mean the code applies to firms across the banking and finance industry. the trade body is also calling on regulators and the government to deliver a long-term, sustainable funding arrangement for app cases where neither the customer nor the bank is at fault. katy worobec added: \u201cthe voluntary code, developed by the banking industry alongside consumer groups, has led to more victims being reimbursed particularly for higher value and more sophisticated scams. \u201chowever, it is now clear that the voluntary code is not delivering consistent outcomes and that new legislation is needed to deliver certainty for both firms and their customers. \u201cthis should go hand in hand with progress towards a sustainable funding solution for cases in which neither the customer or bank is at fault, and a stronger regulatory framework to ensure online platforms and other sectors play their part in tackling fraud.\u201d staying safe uk

against authorised push payment (app) fraud. the code was developed by a steering group comprising of representatives from consumer groups and payment service providers (psps). customers of a payment service provider that is signed up to the code will be fully reimbursed if they fall victim to an app scam, provided they did everything expected of them under the code. nine payment service providers, representing 19 consumer brands and over 85 per cent of authorised push payments, have signed up to the code so far. a list of signatories can be found  here . in situations where both the customer and their payment service provider meet the required standards under the the code, a customer of a signatory firm who falls victim to an app scam will still receive their money back. to fund this compensation, a number of launch signatories of the code established an interim funding arrangement to provide reimbursement until a long-term solution is in place. in february, it was  announced  that this interim funding arrangement is being extended to 31 december 2020, to\u00a0 give more time for regulators, government and the industry to deliver a long-term, sustainable funding arrangement. executive summary of fraud figures for first half of 2020 unauthorised fraud in an unauthorised fraudulent transaction, the account holder themselves does not provide authorisation for

fully refunded in over 98 per cent of unauthorised fraud cases. total losses due to unauthorised fraud across payment cards, remote banking and cheques in the first half of 2020 were \u00a3374.3 million. this is a decrease of eight per cent compared to the first half of 2019. there were a total of 1,397,420 cases of unauthorised financial fraud. included within the overall total: losses due

with the same period in 2019. over three-quarters of card fraud losses (\u00a3222 million) were due to remote purchase fraud, where stolen card details are used to buy something online, over the phone or via mail order. losses due to\u00a0unauthorised remote banking fraud\u00a0totalled \u00a379.7 million in the first half of 2020. this is an increase of 21 per cent compared to the same period in

banking. banks prevented \u00a3181.5 million of attempted unauthorised remote banking fraud in the first half of 2020, up 40 per cent on the same period the previous year. cheque fraud\u00a0losses fell by 78 per cent to \u00a36.4 million compared to the same period last year. intelligence suggests this fall was driven by the reduced use of cheques during the lockdown period as well as increased use of advanced security features on cheques to identify fraudulent ones as they go through the clearing process. over \u00a3184 million of attempted unauthorised cheque fraud was prevented, a fall of nine per cent compared to the first half of 2019. authorised push payment fraud authorised push payment (app) fraud occurs when a customer is duped into authorising a payment to another account which is controlled by a criminal.  the app fraud data for the first half of 2020 shows: a total of \u00a3207.8 million was lost to\u00a0app fraud, in line with the same period last year. this was split between personal accounts (\u00a3164.1 million) and non-personal or business accounts (\u00a343.7 million). there were a total of 66,247 app fraud\u00a0cases, split between personal accounts (63,186 cases) and non-personal accounts (3,061 cases). financial providers were able to return a total of \u00a373.1 million of the losses to victims, an 86 per cent increase on the sum returned in the same period in 2019. investment scams, in which a criminal convinces their victim to move their money to a fictitious fund or to pay for a fake investment, saw the highest increase in losses of any scam type. \u00a355.2 million was lost to this type of fraud, an increase of 27 per cent compared to the same period last year. purchase scams, in which the victim pays in advance for goods or services that are never received, remained the most common form of app fraud in the first half of 2020. these scams accounted for 57 per cent of the total number of app fraud cases in the first half of 2020. the lower average case values mean that they accounted for just 13 per cent of the total value of app fraud in the same period. code \u00a0 under industry voluntary\u00a0 code  on app scams introduced on 28 may 2019, customers of a signatory payment service provider will receive compensation if they fall victim to app fraud, provided they meet the standards expected of them. for the second time, uk finance is publishing statistics relating to the cases assessed under the voluntary code, covering first half of this year from 1 january 2020 until 30 of june 2020. this data\u00a0shows: a total of \u00a3126.5 million was lost to app fraud in cases assessed under the code during this period, of which \u00a347.9 million was reimbursed to victims (38 per cent of the total). this is a significant increase on the 19 per cent of app losses that were reimbursed before the code was introduced. in total 61,333 cases were assessed and closed under the code during this period. of these, 77 per cent involved values of less than \u00a31,000, whilst only 4 per cent of cases involved the more life-changing sums of \u00a310,000 plus. 40 per cent of losses were reimbursed in those cases involving values of \u00a310,000 or more, compared to 30 per cent of losses reimbursed for cases involving values of less than \u00a31,000. reimbursement levels were higher for more sophisticated scams in which criminals impersonate other organisations to target their victims. 54 per cent of losses were reimbursed for bank and police impersonation scams, the highest out of all eight scam types. for purchase scams, 22 per cent of all losses were reimbursed, the smallest proportion of across all eight scam types. these figures do not include all money returned to app fraud victims in all cases,\u00a0for example in some instances where the customer was found at fault under the code but the bank was able to trace and return the original stolen funds."},

to earn easy money during the pandemic, by posting fake adverts on jobs websites and social media. figures reveal there were over 17,000 suspected money mule cases involving 21-30 year olds in 2020, up five per cent on the previous year. the public is being urged to be wary of any offers of earning quick and easy cash online. money muling could lead to a criminal record, the closure of your bank account and difficulty getting a mobile phone contract. cash laundered by money mules is used by criminals to facilitate serious crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and people smuggling. young people whose job prospects have been impacted by the pandemic are being targeted online by criminals looking to recruit money mules to launder the profits of their crimes, uk finance and cifas have warned. the latest research from cifas has revealed there were 17,157 cases of suspected money muling activity involving 21-30 year olds in 2020, a five per cent increase on the previous year. this age group accounted for 42 per cent of money mule activity in 2020, up from 38 per cent three years ago. it was among the hardest hit by the economic impact of covid-19, with thousands facing job losses as a result of the pandemic and graduates entering the jobs market at a time of unprecedented uncertainty. intelligence suggests criminals are exploiting people\u2019s financial difficulties by using social media platforms, jobs websites and phishing emails to approach them with offers of easy cash. they will use the promise of earning money quickly to convince individuals to provide their bank details, before asking them to transfer the funds received to another account and keep some of the cash for themselves, making them a money mule. often, people are unaware that allowing their bank accounts to be used in this way is a crime which will have long-term consequences when they are caught. this could include a criminal record, having their bank account closed and difficulty opening one elsewhere, and trouble obtaining mobile phone contracts or accessing credit in future. those who become money mules are also often not aware that the cash they are laundering is used by criminals to facilitate serious crimes such as terrorism, drug trafficking and people smuggling. the criminals will typically post adverts on legitimate jobs websites or social media, using terms such as \u201cmoney transfer agents\u201d or \u201clocal processors\u201d to recruit people to launder the profits of their crimes. they may also create profiles on social media platforms, infiltrate popular groups or special interest pages to seek out suitable targets, and post images showing off a luxury lifestyle \u2013 for example expensive cars or large quantities of cash \u2013 to entice young people. increasingly, money mule recruiters are making use of heavily encrypted instant messaging services to avoid detection. the figures also show there has been a marked drop in those aged below 21 being recruited as money mules in 2020, with cases falling by 12 per cent to 8,791. this may be due to lockdown restrictions which have\u00a0meant teenagers are spending longer amounts of time at home with their parents and have reduced opportunities for criminals to approach young people in person, for example outside schools and at universities. the overall number of suspected cases of money muling activity across all age groups fell slightly in 2020 from a peak the previous year, but remain 27 per cent higher than in 2017. uk finance and cifas are calling for fraud and economic crime to be included in the upcoming online safety bill. this would make online platforms responsible for taking down fraudulent content, including social media posts or job adverts used to recruit people as money mules. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, commented: \u201ccriminals are cruelly preying on \u2018generation covid\u2019 and those struggling to find work at this difficult time, by using fake job adverts online to recruit people as money mules.  \u201cwe would urge everyone to remain cautious about any offers of quick and easy money and remember that if it sounds too good to be true, it usually is. \u201cat the same time, online platforms must take swift action to detect and take down content being used to promote money muling activity. organised criminal gangs use money mules to launder the profits of their devastating crimes, including fraud, drugs smuggling and people trafficking. we all have a duty to stop them.\u201d mike haley, chief executive officer of cifas, said: \u201callowing your bank account to be used to transfer funds is illegal. although transferring funds doesn\u2019t feel like it\u2019s doing any harm, the money you\u2019re being asked to move often comes from scams and crimes committed against innocent members of the public.  \u201cwe\u2019re now seeing more variations of this type of activity including mules being asked to buy cryptocurrencies or gift cards to mask the stolen funds, making it even more difficult for organisations to trace this money and return it to victims.  \u201cbanks now have sophisticated technology to detect mule activity. when mules are caught, they can expect their bank accounts to be closed and face great difficulty in obtaining credit, mobile phones or loans in the future. it is vital that you keep your bank account to yourself and not be fooled into taking part in this illegal activity.\u201d uk finance and cifas are urging the public to stay safe by following the advice of the  don\u2019t be fooled  campaign: research any potential employer by conducting your own background checks and making sure their contact details are genuine. don\u2019t respond to adverts offering large sums of money for minimal effort. be wary of job ads that are written in poor english with grammatical errors and spelling mistakes. don\u2019t give your bank account details to anyone unless you know and trust them. contact information uk finance press office 020 7416 6750 [email\u00a0protected] press team cifas 0203 004 3644 [email\u00a0protected] notes to editors 1. images

the first half of 2020 through the banking protocol, a scheme that alerts local police to suspected scams. the scheme has prevented victims from losing \u00a3116 million of fraud and led to 744 arrests since it was introduced three years ago. a range of scams that trick elderly and vulnerable customers into withdrawing cash from their branch have been prevented, including courier scams, romance fraud and rogue traders. customers helped through the initiative are typically aged 65 or above, with some over 100 years old. the banking protocol scheme is now being expanded to telephone and online banking. bank branch staff worked with the police to stop \u00a319 million of fraud in the first half of 2020 through the banking protocol, according to the latest figures from uk finance. 1 the banking protocol is a uk-wide scheme that enables bank branch staff to alert their local police force when they suspect a customer is being scammed. police will then visit the branch to investigate the suspected fraud and arrest any suspects still on the scene. \u00a319.3 million of fraud was prevented and over 100 arrests were made through the scheme between january and june 2020. the latest figures mean the scheme has prevented victims losing a total of \u00a3116 million of fraud and led to 744 arrests since it was first introduced three years ago by uk finance, national trading standards and local police forces. 2 the scheme is often used to prevent impersonation scams, in which criminals imitate police or bank staff and convince people to visit their bank and withdraw or transfer large sums of money. these can include courier scams, where those targeted are persuaded to take out a large sum of cash and hand it over to a fraudster posing as a courier. they can also include safe account scams, where the victims are told their money isn\u2019t safe in the account it\u2019s currently in and needs to be transferred to another account. the initiative has also been used to prevent romance fraud, in which fraudsters use fake online dating profiles to trick victims into transferring money, and to catch rogue traders who prey on the elderly by demanding cash for unnecessary work on their property. uk finance has today published top tips from the  take five to stop fraud  campaign on how to stay safe from these scam types. 4 branch staff are trained to spot the warning signs that suggest someone may have fallen for one of these scams and make an emergency call to the police. 3,250 calls have been made in the first six months of this year through the scheme, including 637 in june. data provided by police forces shows that customers helped through the banking protocol are typically aged over 65 while some were over 100 years old, demonstrating how these scams are often targeted towards the elderly and vulnerable. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime, uk finance, commented: \u201cit is sickening that criminals are preying on elderly and vulnerable victims during this difficult time. bank branch staff on the frontline are doing a heroic job in stopping these cruel scams and helping bring those responsible to justice. \u00a0 \u201c the banking industry is now working with police forces to expand this scheme to telephone and online banking, with a focus on protecting vulnerable customers.  \u00a0 \u201cit\u2019s vital that people always follow the advice of the  take five to stop fraud  campaign,  and remember that a bank or the police will never ask you to transfer funds to another account or to withdraw cash to hand over to them for safe-keeping.\u201d t/commander clinton blackburn, from the city of london police, the lead force for fraud, said: \u201cbanks are often the first point of contact when someone is about to fall victim to fraud, so the banking protocol is a vital way of protecting vulnerable victims and preventing criminals from taking advantage of them. \u201chaving a system in place where an immediate police response can be generated to a suspected fraud, allows officers to gain vital evidence and increases our chances of catching the criminal in person, or following the money trail right to their door.\u201d those assisted by the scheme are offered ongoing support to help prevent them falling victim to scams in future, including through referrals to social services, expert fraud prevention advice and additional checks on future transactions. in the first six months of this year, 1,149 potentially vulnerable adults were identified after bank branch staff alerted the police to suspected scams through the scheme. to build on the success of the scheme, discussions are currently underway with local police forces over expanding it to cover attempted bank transfers made by customers through telephone and online banking. this would enable bank staff at call centres to notify police when certain attempted bank transfers are being made which they believe may be the result of a scam, in situations where the customer is unable to visit their local branch to enable further checks. ends for more information please call the uk finance press office on 020 7416 6750 or

by the london metropolitan police in october 2017 and has been operational across all police forces of the uk since march 2018. 52 payment service providers, including all the main high street banks

operating fraudulently and they require assistance to help secure evidence. always remember your bank or the police will never call you to ask you to verify your personal details or pin by phone or offer to pick up your card by courier. hang up, wait a few minutes and call your bank on a number you know to be genuine, such as the one on the back of your card. the police will not contact you out of the blue to participate in an investigation in which you need to withdraw money from your bank or to purchase high value goods for safe keeping. your bank will never send a courier to your home to collect your card and pin therefore any requests to do so are a scam."},

safe from romance scams this valentine\u2019s day. new data from uk finance reveals a 20 per cent increase in bank transfer romance fraud between january and november 2020 compared to the previous year, with the total value of these scams rising by 12 per cent to \u00a318.5 million. the average loss per victim reported to uk finance members was \u00a37,850, highlighting the significant impact this type of fraud can have on victims\u2019 finances. but criminals can trick victims into sending them money in many ways, not just via a bank transfer. action fraud has also seen a rise in reports made by members of the public who have fallen victim to romance fraud in 2020, with total reported losses equating to over \u00a368 million. in these reports, victims have lost money via bank transfer, money transfer, sending fraudsters gift cards and vouchers or presents such as phones and laptops, and providing them with access to their bank account or card. romance scams involve people being duped into sending money to criminals who go to great lengths to gain their trust and convince them that they are in a genuine relationship. they use language to manipulate, persuade and exploit so that requests for money do not raise alarm bells. these requests might be highly emotive, such as criminals claiming they need money for emergency medical care, or to pay for transport costs to visit the victim if they are overseas. the rise in romance scams comes as more people have turned to online dating during 2020 due to social distancing restrictions. figures from the online dating association (oda) estimate that over 2.3 million brits used dating apps during the first lockdown, with 64 per cent of people surveyed seeing dating apps as a lifeline for those living alone. while the internet can be a great way to meet people and form new relationships, the growth in popularity of online dating is giving criminals more opportunities to exploit and coerce people into parting with their money. scammers will often build a relationship with their victims over time, the oda\u2019s data shows that half (53 per cent) of people surveyed are having longer conversations on dating services during lockdown. uk finance is therefore calling on people to look out for their friends and family this valentine\u2019s day. dating app users should also speak to their friends and family and follow the advice of the  take five to stop fraud  campaign to keep themselves safe from scams. \u25cf stop: taking a moment to stop and think before parting with your money or information could

immediately if you think you\u2019ve fallen for a scam and report it to action fraud. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, said: \u201cwith the rising use of online dating service users during lockdown, criminals are using clever tactics to exploit people who think they\u2019ve met their perfect partner online. \u201cromance scams can leave customers out of love and out of pocket, but there are steps people can take to keep themselves or their family and friends safe \u2013 both on and offline. people can help their loved ones spot the signs of a scam, particularly as romance scammers can be very convincing by forming an emotional attachment with their victims. \u201cthe banking and finance industry is working hard to protect customers from fraud, but everyone should remain vigilant to the risks of romance scams. if you suspect you\u2019ve been the victim of a scam, please contact your bank as soon as possible.\u201d george kidd, chief executive of the online dating association, said: \u201coda members work to keep users safe by using human and technology content moderation. many services allow daters to use \u201cselfies\u201d and video to assure others of their identity. the services offer messaging platforms which allow chat in a managed space. daters should make the most of this secure environment and remember the time online is the beginning of getting to know someone you have never met in person. you should never hesitate to report if someone asks you for money, even if they do this outside of the dating service.\u201d pauline smith, head of action fraud, said: \u201clast year, we sadly saw criminals exploit the coronavirus pandemic as a means to commit fraud, and romance fraud was no exception. the national lockdowns, and other restrictions on our social lives, implemented because of the coronavirus outbreak, have meant more people have been seeking companionship online and this has undoubtedly affected the number of reports we have seen. \u201cit\u2019s important to say that most online dating sites, social media sites and gaming apps are perfectly safe. however, any online platform that allows you to connect with and talk to other people could be targeted by romance fraudsters so it\u2019s important to remain vigilant. \u201cif you think you\u2019ve been a victim of romance fraud, please don\u2019t feel ashamed or embarrassed \u2013 you are not alone. anyone can fall victim to fraud, but it\u2019s important that contact your bank immediately and report it to action fraud.\u201d signs your friend or family member may be involved in a romance scam: \u2022 they may be very secretive about their relationship or provide excuses for why their online partner has not video called or met them in person. they might become hostile or angry, and withdraw from conversation when you ask any questions about their partner \n\u2022 they may express very strong emotions and commitment to someone they have only just met \n\u2022 they have sent, or are planning to send, money to someone they have not met face-to-face. they may take out loans or withdraw from their pension to send money. how users can stay safe from romance scams: \u2022 be suspicious of any requests for money from someone you have never met in person, particularly if you have only recently met online. \n\u2022 speak to your family or friends to get advice. \n\u2022 profile photos may not be genuine, do your research first. performing a reverse image search on a search engine can find photos that have been taken from somewhere, or someone, else. if you think you have been a victim of a romance scam, do not feel ashamed or embarrassed \u2013 you are not alone. contact your bank immediately and report it to action fraud on 0300 123 2040 or via actionfraud.police.uk. if you are in scotland, please report to police scotland directly by calling 101. no matter how long you\u2019ve been speaking to someone online and how

romance scam, but later contacted their bank to withdraw the claim. the bank asked more questions which led them to believe that the customer was the victim of a romance scam and would continue to be victimised if they made additional payments to the account they had previously reported. the bank continued to engage with the customer, whilst also monitoring the customer\u2019s account. this showed that the customer was still trying to make payments to the suspected fraudster on numerous occasions but, despite the bank\u2019s interventions, they could not convince the customer of the scam. the bank, having exhausted all options, submitted a banking protocol email referral. local police went to the victim\u2019s house the same day, confirmed the bank\u2019s suspicions and provided victim

to beware of  criminals exploiting covid-19  to impersonate the police, banks, or government organisations uk finance is urging people to be aware of criminals exploiting covid-19 to target their victims, after figures revealed a sharp rise in impersonation scams in the first half of this year. impersonation scams occur when the victim is convinced to make a payment to a criminal claiming to be from a trusted organisation. this could include the police, a bank, a utility company, or a government department. there were almost 15,000 impersonation scam cases reported by uk finance members between january and june 2020, an increase of 84 per cent compared to the same period last year. among these, over 8,220 cases involved criminals impersonating the police or a bank, a year-on-year rise of 94 per cent. another 6,730 cases involved fraudsters imitating other trusted organisations such as a utility company, communications service provider or government department, an increase of 74 per cent. \u00a358 million was lost to impersonation scams in january to june 2020, up three per cent on the previous year. this was split between \u00a336.7m lost to bank and police impersonation scams and \u00a321.2 million lost to scams impersonating other trusted organisations. scams involving the criminal impersonating a bank or the police often begin with a phone call or text message claiming there has been fraud on the victim\u2019s account. the customer is then convinced that to protect their money they must transfer it to a \u2018safe account\u2019 which actually belongs to the fraudster. other common scams involve text messages or emails claiming a victim must settle a fine, pay overdue tax or return a refund that was given by mistake. intelligence reported to uk finance suggests that the rise in impersonation scams is being partly driven by criminals exploiting covid-19. these scams include fraudsters sending emails or text messages pretending to be from government departments and offering grants related to covid-19. criminals may also get in touch claiming to be from an airline or travel agency, offering refunds for flights or holidays that have been cancelled due to the pandemic. additionally, criminals are exploiting the growing numbers of people working remotely, by posing as it departments or software providers and claiming that payments are needed to fix problems with people\u2019s internet connection or broadband or asking for remote access to the victim\u2019s computer. criminals will tend to research their targets first, using information gathered from other scams, social media and data breaches in order to make their approach sound genuine. they will also often try to rush or panic their potential victims into making a payment, for example by claiming their money is at risk or their account will be blocked unless they act. katy worobec, managing director of economic crime at uk finance, commented: \u201ccriminal gangs are ruthlessly exploiting this pandemic to commit fraud, so it\u2019s vital we all work together to beat them. \u00a0 \u201cwe are urging the public to remain vigilant against these vile scams and remember that criminals are experts at impersonating people, organisations and the police. fraudsters  will spend hours researching their victims, but they only need you to let your guard down for a minute. \u00a0 \u201calways take a moment to stop and think if you receive a request to make a payment from someone claiming to be from an organisation you trust. instead, contact the company or organisation directly using a known email or phone number, like the one on their official website.\u201d the banking and finance industry has put in place a range of measures to combat impersonation scams. 1  this includes the  banking protocol , a scheme that allows bank branch staff to alert police to suspected scams and which prevented \u00a319 million of fraud and led to over 100 arrests in the first half of this year. the industry is also working closely with  ofcom  to crack down on number spoofing and with the mobile phone industry to  block  scam text messages including those

{"header": "fact sheet: the american rescue plan will deliver immediate economic relief to families", "date": "2021-03-18t21:30:16z", "text": "the current public health crisis and resulting economic crisis have devastated the health and economic wellbeing of millions of americans. from big cities to small towns, americans \u2013 particularly people of color, immigrants, and low-wage workers \u2013 are facing a deep economic crisis. more than 9.5 million workers have lost their jobs in the wake of the pandemic, with 4 million out of work for half a year or longer. \n\n the american rescue plan will change the course of the pandemic and deliver immediate and direct relief to families and workers impacted by the covid-19 crisis through no fault of their own. this law is one of the most progressive pieces of legislation in history, and will build a bridge to an equitable economic recovery. \n\n economic impact payments \n\n through this third round of economic impact payments, the u.s. department of the treasury (treasury department) and the internal revenue service (irs) are ensuring that americans will receive fast and direct relief during the final phase of the covid-19 crisis. as of yesterday,  approximately 90 million economic impact payments had been disbursed , thereby ensuring that  more than $242 billion  of much-needed relief will be received by millions of americans and their families within days of enactment of the american rescue plan. unlike the prior rounds of economic impact payments, the american rescue plan requires a 2021 \u201ctrue-up\u201d additional payment, when applicable, based on information (such as a recently filed 2020 tax return) that the irs receives mid-year during 2021. this additional economic impact payment will ensure that americans and their families receive greater amounts of financial assistance during 2021, rather than waiting to claim a recovery rebate credit on a tax return in 2022. \n\n those eligible will automatically receive an economic impact payment of up to $1,400 for individuals or \n\n $2,800 for married couples, plus $1,400 for each dependent. unlike the prior rounds of economic impact payments, families will get a payment for all their dependents claimed on a tax return, not just their qualifying children under 17. \n\n normally, a taxpayer will qualify for the full amount if they have an adjusted gross income of up to \n\n $75,000 for singles and married persons filing a separate return, up to $112,500 for heads of household, and up to $150,000 for married couples filing joint returns and surviving spouses. payment amounts are reduced for filers with incomes above those levels. \n\n the treasury department and the irs continue to expand outreach to the millions of homeless, rural poor, and other disadvantaged americans to ensure that they receive economic impact payments. this includes new and continued relationships with homeless shelters, legal aid clinics, and providing economic impact payment information in more than 35 languages. \n\n child tax credit \n\n the american rescue plan\u2019s expansion of the child tax credit will substantially reduce child poverty by supplementing the earnings of families receiving the tax credit. specifically, the child tax credit has been revised in the following ways: \n\n the credit amount has been increased.  the american rescue plan increased the amount of the child tax credit from $2,000 to $3,600 for children under age 6, and $3,000 for other children under age 18. \n\t the credit\u2019s scope has been expanded.  children 17 years old and younger, as opposed to 16 years old and younger, will now be covered by the child tax credit. \n\t credit amounts will be made through advance payments during 2021.  individuals eligible for a 2021 child tax credit will receive advance payments of the individual\u2019s credit, which the irs and the bureau of the fiscal service will make through periodic payments from july 1, to december 31, 2021. this change will allow struggling families to receive financial assistance now, rather than waiting until the 2022 tax filing season to receive the child tax credit benefit. \n\t the credit is now fully refundable.  by making the child tax credit fully refundable, low- income households will be entitled to receive the full credit benefit, as significantly expanded and increased by the american rescue plan. \n\t the credit is now extended to puerto rico and the u.s. territories.  for the first time, low- income families residing in puerto rico and the u.s. territories will receive this vital financial assistance to better support their children\u2019s development and health and educational attainment. to facilitate the disbursement of child tax credit advance payments during 2021, the american rescue plan requires the irs to establish an online portal for taxpayers to update relevant data for mid-year payment adjustments (for example, the birth of a child during 2021). in addition to this online tool, the treasury department and the irs will carry out a sweeping public awareness campaign parallel to its economic impact payment campaign to reach all americans who may be eligible for this financial assistance. \n\n state and local fiscal recovery fund \n\n state, local and tribal governments across america have been under an unprecedented strain in the wake of the covid-19 crisis. while the need for services has increased \u2014including setting up emergency medical facilities, standing up vaccination sites, and supporting struggling small businesses\u2014state and local revenues have plummeted as a result of the economic fallout from the crisis. at the height of the fallout, public sector employment fell by around 1.4 million jobs, including layoffs of 1 million educators, compared to around 750,000 job losses during the great recession. as a result, communities have faced \n\n untenable choices, between laying off educators, firefighters and other frontline workers or failing to provide services that communities rely on. \n\n the american rescue plan provides  $350 billion dollars  in emergency funding for state, local, territorial, and tribal governments to remedy this mismatch between rising costs and falling revenues. this includes: \n\n $195 billion for states, (a minimum of $500 million for each state); \n\t $130 billion for local governments (a minimum of $1.25 billion per state is provided by the statute inclusive of the amounts allocated to local governments within the state); \n\t $20 billion for tribal governments; and \n\t $4.5 billion for territories the rescue plan will provide needed relief to state, local, and tribal governments to enable them to continue to support the public health response and lay the foundation for a strong and equitable economic recovery. in addition to helping these governments address the revenue losses they have experienced as a result of the crisis, it will help them cover the costs incurred due responding to the public health emergency and provide support for a recovery \u2013 including through assistance to households, small businesses and nonprofits, aid to impacted industries, and support for essential workers. it will also provide resources for state, local, and tribal governments to invest in infrastructure, including water, sewer, and broadband services. \n\n capital projects fund \n\n the covid-19 crisis starkly illuminated key shortcomings \u2013 and inequalities \u2013 in u.s. infrastructure. while some communities were able to adapt to the pandemic with remote or socially-distanced options for work, education, and health care, others lacked the infrastructure needed to do so, compounding the disruptions of the pandemic and exacerbating existing inequalities, with long-term consequences for american families. one particularly salient infrastructure challenge has been the digital divide and the absence of foundational conditions that enable network connectivity and access. as more and more areas of work and education move online, this divide risks leaving many american families behind. \n\n recognizing these challenges, the american rescue plan provides  $10 billion  for states, territories, and tribes to cover the costs of capital projects like broadband infrastructure. \n\n the capital projects fund takes critical steps to addressing these challenges laid bare by the pandemic, especially in rural america and low- and moderate-income communities, helping to ensure that all communities have access to the high-quality, modern infrastructure needed to thrive, including internet access. \n\n homeowner assistance fund \n\n as the economic fallout from the covid-19 crisis took form, millions of americans were faced with the pressures of having to decide between making mortgage payments and other essential obligations. this was especially true for the low-income communities and communities of color who bore the brunt of this crisis. across the country, one in 10 homeowners with a mortgage are behind on payments. the law takes immediate steps to help americans stay in their homes and keep a roof over their heads. \n\n the american rescue plan provides nearly  $10 billion  for states, territories, and tribes to provide relief for our country\u2019s most vulnerable homeowners. this includes: \n\n a minimum of $50 million for each state, the district of columbia and puerto rico; \n\t $30 million for the territories of guam, american samoa, the united states virgin islands, and the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands; \n\t an explicit mandate to prioritize socially disadvantaged households; the law prioritizes those homeowners that have experienced the greatest hardships, leveraging local and national income indicators to maximize intended impact. applicable funding uses include delinquent mortgage payments, allowing americans across the country to take a step in the right direction toward household stabilization. these necessary actions will minimize foreclosures in the coming months, alleviate emergency shelter capacity, and mitigate potential covid-19 infections. \n\n emergency rental assistance \n\n an underlying consequence of the covid-19 pandemic is that household stability is not just a financial security issue, but also a health concern. as the country entered the throes of the crisis, many cities and states began creating or expanding rental assistance programs to support at-risk households. the december appropriations bill provided $25 billion of federal relief to be administered by the emergency rental assistance (era) program for disbursement to existing state and local government programs. the american rescue plan nearly doubles the initial funding to expand the reach and impact of the existing era program, taking additional steps to mitigate the financial harm caused by the pandemic and keeping americans safe as the country addresses the virus. \n\n the american rescue plan provides  $21.6 billion  for states, territories, and local governments to assist households that are unable to pay rent and utilities due to the covid-19 crisis. this includes: \n\n a minimum of $152 million for each state and the district of columbia; \n\t $305 million for the commonwealth of puerto rico, the united states virgin islands, guam, the commonwealth of the northern mariana islands, and american samoa; \n\t $2.5 billion for payments to \u201chigh-need grantees,\u201d locations with an urgent need for assistance when factoring conditions such as change in employment, concentration of very low-income renters, and rental market costs as a result of the american rescue plan, states and localities across the country will be better armed to provide relief and assistance to those vulnerable households. the new funding will leverage existing program structures, allowing for money to be disbursed quickly and efficiently to on the ground emergency programs, and ensuring this country\u2019s hardest-hit families to receive their equitable share of relief. \n\n state small business credit initiative \n\n it is no secret that the pandemic has disproportionately impacted small businesses across the country, particularly those owned and operated by women and minorities. every community has had to face the unfortunate reality of local storefronts that are closing or have closed, resulting in friends and family members being furloughed or laid off. nationally, small business revenue is down 32 percent, and at least 400,000 firms have permanently closed. after a year of the public health crisis, many businesses are hanging on by a thread. within this law are plans to provide critical assistance to small businesses across the country, facilitating the urgent deployment of capital and support to help these organizations not just persevere, but recover on solid footing. \n\n the american rescue plan provides  $10 billion  to state and tribal governments to fund small business credit expansion initiatives. this program will build off the inaugural model developed in 2011 during the obama-biden administration, in which nearly $1.5 billion in capital supported over $8 billion in new lending and investing activity across 142 different programs in its first 5 years. the new iteration will expand in scale and include: \n\n $1.5 billion for states to support businesses owned by socially and economically disadvantaged people; \n\t $1 billion for an incentive program to boost funding tranches for states that show robust support for such businesses; and \n\t $500 million to support very small businesses with fewer than 10 employees; this law will inject capital into state small business support and capital access programs, provide collateral support, facilitate loan participation, and enable credit guarantee programs. it will boost state venture capital programs and provide funding for technical support and assistance. this administration recognizes that small businesses\u2014enterprises that are responsible for two-thirds of net new jobs in this country\u2014are the backbone of the american economy, and a bellwether of economic progress. \n\n employee retention credit and paid leave credit programs \n\n in addition to the ssbci, the american rescue plan extends a number of critical tax benefits to small businesses that are intended to help businesses through to the recovery while keeping up their payrolls and still taking steps to protect health outcomes for employees. \n\n the american rescue plan extends the availability of the employee retention credit for small businesses through december 2021 and allows businesses to offset their current payroll tax liabilities by  up to \n\n $7,000 per employee per quarter . this credit of up to $28,000 per employee for 2021 is available to small businesses who have seen their revenues decline, or even been temporarily shuttered, due to covid. \n\n the american rescue plan also extends through september 2021 the availability of paid leave credits for small and midsize businesses that offer paid leave to employees who may take leave due to illness, quarantine, or caregiving. businesses can take  dollar-for-dollar tax credits equal to wages of up to \n\n $5,000  if they offer paid leave to employees who are sick or quarantining. paid leave credits are a powerful incentive to encourage the offer of paid sick and family leave, which will help keep the virus under control by ensuring sick employees can stay home. \n\n unemployment compensation \n\n across the nation, millions of americans lost their jobs in the wake of the covid-19 pandemic and, as a result, claimed unemployment benefits. the american rescue plan waives federal income taxes on the first $10,200 of unemployment benefits received in 2020 by middle- and lower-income taxpayers. the tax relief extends to both workers who received benefits through federal unemployment programs as well as those who received traditional benefits through their state unemployment insurance fund. this law will provide tax relief for americans who lost their jobs and utilized unemployment benefits last year \u2013 allowing millions of workers to focus their benefits on covering essentials during the covid-19 pandemic. \n\n fact sheet: the american rescue plan will deliver immediate economic relief to families (3/18/21)"},
{"header": "testimony of janet l. yellen, secretary u.s. department of the treasury, before the committee on finance services u.s. house of representatives", "date": "2021-03-24t00:49:37z", "text": "chairwoman waters, ranking member mchenry, members of the committee, thank you for having me. \n\n we are meeting at a hopeful moment for the economy \u2013 but still a daunting one. while we\u2019re seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we\u2019re digging out of: the country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak. \n\n when congress passed the cares and consolidated appropriations acts last year, it gave the federal government some powerful tools to address the crisis. but upon taking office, i worried they weren\u2019t powerful enough. after all, there were \u2013 and still are \u2013 some very deep pockets of pain in the data. \n\n one-in-ten homeowners with a mortgage are behind on their payments, and almost one-in-five renters are behind on their rent. there are 22 million people who say they don\u2019t have enough food to eat. one-in-ten adults are hungry in america. \n\n i looked at data like these, and i worried that the covid economy was going to keep hurting millions of people now and haunt them long after the health emergency was over. \n\n we know that when the foundations of someone\u2019s life fall apart \u2013 when they lose the roof over their head or the ability to eat dinner every night \u2013 the pain can weigh on them for years. their earning potential is permanently lowered.\u00a0 i worried about this happening on a mass scale. \n\n that\u2019s why i advocated very hard for the american rescue plan, and it\u2019s why my first \u2013 and most enthusiastic \u2013 message today is: thank you. \n\n with the passage of the rescue plan, i am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact. and i believe they will be met there by a growing economy. in fact, i think we may see a return to full employment next year. \n\n of course, the speed and strength of our recovery depends, in part, on how we implement the legislation. treasury is tasked with much of that work, and there is nothing that i \u2013 or my team \u2013 take more seriously. we appreciate your oversight on this matter, and i want to briefly tell you about how we\u2019ve been working. \u00a0 \n\n since taking office two months ago, we have been expediting relief to the areas of greatest need. for example, small businesses \u2013 and especially the smallest small businesses, which are disproportionally owned by women and people of color. \n\n the pandemic has hit these businesses hard. the paycheck protection program was an early lifeline, but because of issues with the program\u2019s design, the first rounds often didn\u2019t reach the smallest sole proprietorships. we\u2019re addressing that now. we worked with sba to tweak how the program was implemented. it\u2019s allowing the ppp to reach millions more microbusinesses and entrepreneurs, especially in rural and low-income areas. \n\n we\u2019re also building capacity to support these communities over the longer term. because of the december legislation, treasury now has $12 billion to inject into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. in turn, these cdfis and mdis can lend that capital out, helping people buy homes and start businesses in places that the financial services sector traditionally hasn\u2019t served well. \u00a0 \n\n then, there are the families i spoke about, the ones struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table. \n\n the american rescue plan provides more than $30 billion to help renters and homeowners at risk of losing their homes. and we\u2019re making sure that assistance flows as efficiently as possible. \n\n for instance, the previous administration put in place rules that required tenants and landlords to provide quite a bit of documentation to get rental assistance, including detailed statements about their income. but some people don\u2019t have access to those documents. we\u2019re cutting through the red tape for them, while still taking reasonable steps to prevent fraud and abuse. \n\n and of course, we\u2019ve been sending direct payments to americans \u2013 a lot of americans. as of last week, we had issued over 90 million payments.\u00a0 \n\n and all this is just a fraction of treasury\u2019s work. there are so many more relief programs, including one that will provide $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. implementing all of it is more complicated than it sounds, and we are working closely with stakeholders to make sure that these programs are both efficient and effective. \n\n behind these many relief programs, these millions of transactions, are a staff of very dedicated (and very tired) treasury and irs employees. my final word is to them: thank you. you are putting on a master class in how government should work in the furnace of a crisis. i\u2019m grateful to be your colleague. \n\n with that, i am happy to answer any

chen mingguo , director of the xinjiang public security bureau (xpsb).\u00a0 these individuals are designated pursuant to executive order (e.o.) 13818, which builds upon and implements the global

and canada, which imposed sanctions on these individuals and others.\u00a0 the united states will continue to play a strong leadership role in global efforts to combat serious human rights abuse in xinjiang and around the world through the global magnitsky sanctions program. \u00a0complementary actions using these global human rights sanctions regimes enable likeminded partners to form a unified front to identify, promote accountability for, and disrupt access to the international financial system by those who abuse human rights. \n\n serious human rights abuse in xinjiang \n\n due to their roles in the xpcc and xpsb, respectively,  wang junzheng  ( wang ) and  chen mingguo  ( chen ) are connected to serious human rights abuses against ethnic minorities in xinjiang, which reportedly includes arbitrary detention and severe physical abuse, among other serious human rights abuses targeting uyghurs, a turkic muslim population indigenous to xinjiang, and other ethnic minorities in the

in recognition that the prevalence of human rights abuse and corruption that have their source, in whole or in substantial part, outside the united states, had reached such scope and gravity as to threaten the stability of international political and economic systems. \u00a0human rights abuse and corruption undermine the values that form an essential foundation of stable, secure, and

markets. the fca welcomes recommendations to look at aligning prospectus documentation requirements with the type of capital raise being undertaken. there is scope to simplify and remove costs from some parts of the mifidii regime without material loss of benefits. it\u2019s a pleasure to be with you all \u2013 virtually at least \u2013 this afternoon for isla\u2019s 11th post trade conference. it\u2019s been quite a year \u2013 actually a year and a half \u2013 since the 10th annual conference in october 2019. financial markets have endured the pandemic \u2013 and have been helping economies begin to recover from that pandemic. the uk left first the eu, and then at end-december last year, the eu single market. 11 weeks into the uk\u2019s post-eu future, i know there is a lot of interest in the opportunities for london\u2019s much-envied financial markets, and the fca\u2019s approach to regulating these going forwards given that rule-setting powers have been returned from brussels and paris to london. we will be building on strong foundations. for the past 10 years i have enjoyed the personal privilege of being part of regulating and supervising london\u2019s wholesale financial markets \u2013 first at the bank of england, and more recently at the fca, and seeing just how strong those foundations are. i have been able to enjoy working with genuinely world-leading infrastructures for clearing, and for trading, and hugely talented individuals from the sell-side, the buy-side, from our law and professional services firms. i have seen what this community can deliver, whether that\u2019s building new infrastructure such as trade repositories, or improving the way markets function, as in the \u2013 initially seemingly impossible \u2013 task of transition from libor. looking ahead, we have a new opportunity and ability to shape our regulatory framework in a way that maximises the scope for the practitioners and customers of the uk\u2019s financial markets to prosper. you will have seen the chancellor\u2019s announcement in his budget that the government is examining the case for capital markets reforms, and that it will set out further plans on this soon. the fca shares the government\u2019s determination to ensure our regulatory framework is tailored to allow uk financial markets and their users, from around the globe, to thrive. the fca shares the government\u2019s determination to ensure our regulatory framework is tailored to allow uk financial markets and their users, from around the globe, to thrive. that doesn\u2019t mean change for the sake of change. we know change can carry unwanted costs. nor does it mean seeking low standards in pursuit of competitive advantage. we don\u2019t think low standards are a competitive advantage. but where regulation has imposed costs without beneficial outcomes to justify that cost, then we will want to use our new ability to change direction. let me turn to a couple of specific examples, close to the interests of this audience. sftr reporting i will start with the securities financing transaction regulation (sftr). this reporting regime is one of the last pieces of regulation implemented in response to the 2008/09 financial crisis. this has helped create a data set that supports a financial stability board (fsb) recommendation, endorsed by the g20, to enhance transparency of the securities lending and repo markets. as this audience knows well, the securities financing market supports liquidity management and trading liquidity in large parts of the financial system. the effort to improve data on this key market reflects the importance that authorities attach to the market\u2019s smooth functioning. following a 6-month delay beyond its previously planned implementation date, sftr reporting finally came into application in the eu and in the uk in july 2020 for credit institutions, investment firms, ccps and csds. the delay of the first phase-in was a response to the immediate impact of covid-19, allowing those firms to focus resource on managing their own liquidity risks and other priorities during that challenging period. sftr has been a complex regulatory reporting regime to implement. we recognise the considerable time and money this will have consumed. the number of fields to report is large. there is considerable complexity in how some are populated. despite this, and the added complications of managing covid-19 impacts, we saw largely smooth implementation, and relatively few issues compared with what might have been expected for a reporting regime of this scale. the engagement with firms and trade associations, including a very useful roundtable with isla and some of its members, has been good. we hope and expect this open dialogue with you will continue. in onshoring sftr, the fca also assumed the new role of trade repository (tr) supervision. that role now dovetails neatly with supervision of the firms who report to trs. this will make it easier to encourage efficient and timely remediation of reporting issues, feeding better data quality. as sftr was already in application for investment firms, credit institutions, ccps, csds, ucits, aifs, insurance companies and pensions funds by the end of the brexit transition period, we onshored the sftr regime for these firms as it was. however, for non-financial companies (nfcs), for whom the regime only came into force in the eu in january 2021 \u2013 after the end of the transition period \u2013 we were not under the same obligation to onshore this extension of the reporting regime. reporting by nfcs was not required under the fsb recommendation. given that nfc-to-nfc securities lending or repo is rare, we don\u2019t think such reporting is necessary for data adequacy or financial stability purposes. the fca therefore encouraged and supported hm treasury\u2019s decision not to bring non-financial companies into scope of uk sftr reporting. where nfcs do have significant trading activity, we will still be able to see almost all these transactions as they will be reported by their financial counterparties. we are often asked whether we intend to diverge any further from the current regime. it seems prudent to allow the regime to mature before we consider if there is a case for refinement or trimming. we seek a balance in which the regime meets its overall objectives while remaining proportionate in terms of cost and operational burdens for uk-based firms. one change we are open to considering\u00a0is whether to remove commodities lending transactions from scope. these transactions were not included within the original fsb recommendations which focused on repo, securities lending and margin lending. we will also assess carefully the evidence on the relative benefits of single versus double-sided reporting. this is something market participants and trade bodies have often raised with us in the context of emir reporting. but many of the costs of implementation, including of this 2-sided model, have already been borne. we do not wish to add to these costs with further expense from unnecessary change. we and the eu will continue to have very strong common interests in the functioning of our regulatory frameworks. likewise, we are conscious that many uk-based firms are part of groups with eu entities subject to the eu sftr regime. divergence between the 2 regimes could add additional complication or cost to groups who would then have to adhere to 2 different sets of reporting requirements. this is just 1 small example of a wider reality that we and the eu will continue to have very strong common interests in the functioning of our regulatory frameworks. any future policy considerations will also be made in close cooperation with our colleagues at the bank of england, who will have responsibility for submitting the aggregated uk data to the fsb, and of course with hmt, who would be responsible for any amendments to the primary sftr legislation. csdr another regulation of importance to this community is the central securities depositories regulation. as with sftr, the csdr regime was onshored into uk legislation as it stood at the end of the transition period. however, the eu csdr settlement discipline regime had not begun to apply before the end of the transition period. consequently, it could not be included in the uk csdr as part of the onshoring process. and hmt could decide whether and how we implemented the settlement discipline regime in the uk csdr. consistent with fca advice, hmt decided not to implement the eu csdr settlement discipline regime in the uk. for many years, we had argued in relevant eu fora that the case for introducing the regime, in particular the buy-in provisions and arrangements for resolving failed transactions, was not strong. both buy-side and sell-side representatives have consistently expressed their concerns to us about these provisions. they have pointed to a seemingly credible risk of negative impact on market liquidity, perhaps particularly on the securities of smaller issuers. that is a risk we have no desire to take. some may have been attracted to these csdr buy-in provisions and penalties as a constraint on short-selling activities. but we think the short selling regulation is the better, more direct and more effective vehicle for setting regulatory parameters around that market. investors in securities value liquidity. we should be wary of introducing measures which stand to reduce that liquidity in the name of investor protection. of course, together with colleagues at the bank of england and hmt, we will remain open to ideas on whether, and, if so, how, the uk\u2019s settlement arrangements could be refreshed to support both market liquidity and settlement efficiency. we would be happy to work with the grain of market consensus if and where there is a case for change. the wider capital markets framework in addition to post trade regulations, we also inherit from the eu the extensive framework of legislation and rules around secondary market trading \u2013 notably, but not only, in the form of mifid ii \u2013 and around primary market issuance of securities \u2013 in the form of the prospectus regulation. we see real efficiency and effectiveness gains in better aligning prospectus documentation requirements with the type of transaction being undertaken. on the primary markets side, lord hill\u2019s recent review has usefully flagged scope for reform to the prospectus regime. we see real efficiency and effectiveness gains in better aligning prospectus documentation requirements with the type of transaction being undertaken. follow-on capital raising by companies whose shares are already listed and traded on public markets is a very different type of transaction from an off-market public offer by a private company. yet the prospectus regulation seeks to cover both with the same rules. that was the result of a regulatory compromise in the eu. it is timely to revisit this framework, making the route to capital raising through public markets one which is efficient for issuers because the regulatory requirements are focused tightly on what their investors actually need, while maintaining alignment with existing standards where this is more efficient for market participants operating in uk, eu and other international markets. the fca is carefully considering lord hill\u2019s recommendations for changes to our own listing rules, in line with our objectives, including on free float, dual class share structures, and special purpose acquisition companies (spacs). we are treating a response to these as a priority. it is timely to assess where mifid ii rules, and the costs some of them impose, have \u2013 or have not \u2013 achieved the intended benefits. on secondary markets for securities, derivatives, and other investments, it is timely to assess where mifid ii rules, and the costs some of them impose, have \u2013 or have not \u2013 achieved the intended benefits. the eu has been reflecting on this too, as we have seen in the already agreed changes in the so-called mifid \u2018quick fix\u2019. we will shortly put out to consultation in the uk a similar set of changes \u2013 not absolutely identical, but we hope at least equally effective in achieving the same desired outcomes. we have also had to consider or decide how to implement on a uk-only (as opposed to eu-wide) basis various elements of the mifid transparency regime. for example, whether and when so-called \u2018dark\u2019 trading should be capped, and how thresholds for post-trade, and, in particular, pre-trade transparency should be calculated. on dark trading, our initial approach is not to have automated caps in the absence of evidence that the levels of dark trading we have seen harm price formation or execution outcomes for investors, and given no need to preserve alignment of cap application in the absence of the eu accepting the equivalence of the uk share trading regime. \u00a0it\u2019s no secret that the fca has long been sceptical about the merits of this regime. the adjective \u2018dark\u2019 sounds unhelpfully pejorative. this is investors trying to protect their own interests by not telegraphing before they need to, their desire to buy or sell a share. on threshold calculation and application, there are important questions about how best to achieve desired outcomes, and whether the complex, sometimes costly and cumbersome calculation procedures, do achieve those outcomes. we may be able to find ways of simplifying this currently elaborate machinery. flexibility in our approach may indeed create options for alignment across jurisdictions where that is important for industry efficiency or other reasons. that might be better for all than rigidly insisting on different transparency thresholds for the same instruments in different jurisdictions because those thresholds are derived, under the letter of current mifid rules, from different data sets. the detailed machinery of the mifid ii transparency regime can be difficult to follow for those not immersed in its detail, but the key point is that we have important opportunities to refine our framework for securities and derivatives trading in a way that helps those doing business here, without sacrificing equivalent outcomes in terms of investor protection and market integrity. another part of mifid ii about which we have expressed doubts from the outset is the commodity derivatives regime. the eu has also identified the need for revisiting this regime as part of its \u2018quick fix\u2019. we think there is scope substantially to simplify this regime. as we look to key themes of the years ahead, what is most striking is the common challenges facing market regulators in all jurisdictions \u2013 in the uk, the eu, the united states and beyond. for example, we have been working together \u2013 through fsb and iosco \u2013 to look at what lessons can be learnt from the impact of covid-19 on our markets, notably in terms of the liquidity stresses experienced in asset markets, and in various fund structures. we are also working together on how financial markets can support that all-important transition to net zero. as with the global work completed over past years and now embedded in regulatory frameworks across jurisdictions \u2013 such as the agreement of common and equivalent standards for clearing and settlement, or the improved international data collection on securities financing markets which i talked about earlier \u2013 we will be striving for common outcomes. we face the same global issues. the most effective and efficient way of addressing them will be through globally connected markets. we look forward to ensuring our approach in the uk is an integrated part of that coordinated international effort.

report launch. delivered: \u00a016 march 2021 note: \u00a0this is the speech as drafted and may differ from the delivered version highlights it\u2019s important for us to get this right as an employer, in order\u00a0that\u00a0we can lead by example and get it right as a regulator. our work on firm culture is seeking to ensure cultures are purposeful and safe, and they support environments that are diverse and inclusive. in keeping with our responsibilities under the public sector equality duty we use equality impact assessments as part of our policy making to ensure that we\u00a0make policy which benefits a diverse\u00a0population. i\u2019m very pleased to be here for the virtual launch of the investment association and eversheds report: building ethnic diversity and inclusion in investment management. there\u2019s no dinner party if we all wait for others to come to the table first, so thank you to the investment association for bringing us all to the table with this report:\u00a0a great addition to the menu of reports by the association which do a good job of sharing some sobering data and describing what good looks like. there would be an unfortunate irony in failing to recognise the range\u00a0of financial services firms across and within sectors, and pushing a one size fits all approach to d&i. it is unfortunately clear that there is plenty of work yet to do to secure diversity and inclusion in investment management, particularly when it comes to ethnic diversity. i don\u2019t know if it\u2019s rude dinner party behaviour to quote your host\u2019s data back at them but: less than 1% of investment managers are black people in finance from privileged backgrounds earn \u00a317,500 more than those from working class backgrounds only 11% of members have a female ceo or chair there is a median gender pay gap of 28% in financial services, rising to 31% in the asset management sector think of all that untapped talent which makes for a very strong business case for ethnic diversity in the investment industry: the 2017 mcgregor-smith review found that the potential benefit to the uk economy from full representation of black and minority ethnic individuals across the labour market, is estimated to be \u00a324 bn a year the mckinsey \u2018diversity wins\u2019 report, published in may 2020, found that the most ethnically diverse companies are 35% more likely to outperform the least diverse the ability to share best practice and exchange ideas and experience is a crucial part of making progress on diversity and inclusion (d&i) at an individual firm level and at a collective sector level. but when i say collective, i don\u2019t mean uniform. there would be an unfortunate irony in failing to recognise the range of financial services firms across and within sectors, and pushing a one size fits all approach to d&i. but we all have to start somewhere, and sharing ideas is an excellent way to do that. we, as a regulator, have a role to play in all of this and that role starts close to home, in what we do as an employer, where the challenges we face are similar to the challenges any firm faces. the fca as an employer as an employer, we try to lead by example. this doesn\u2019t mean that we hold ourselves up as having the answers to all the questions, far from it. but if we talk about the importance of data, we have to collect data. when we talk about the benefits of targets, we have to have targets ourselves. when we talk about the value of transparency, we have to be transparent ourselves. when we talk about the importance of having difficult conversations, we have to be up for having those difficult conversations about ourselves. we are using data to better understand the challenges we face and to hold ourselves to account and monitor own our progress or lack of it. for us as an employer, this means driving action in 3 priority areas: gender, ethnicity and social mobility - and making sure that we move from the \u2018d\u2019 of diversity, to the \u2018i\u2019 of inclusion. that is, making sure that not only do we bring diverse colleagues in at junior levels, but those colleagues thrive and prosper and get good opportunities to show what they are capable of and to progress through the organisation. and we readily admit that we have some challenges to overcome. statistics\u00a0show that 30% of our associate colleagues are black, asian and minority ethnic (bame), however only 10% of our senior leadership team are bame. while this beats our 8% target for 2020, there is still an uncomfortable discrepancy between junior and senior levels. this is reflected in our (mean) ethnicity pay gap which is 27%. while this is not an equal pay for equal work issue it is not something we are proud of. to drive transparency around this we have published  our ethnicity action plan . this goes hand in hand with using data and setting stretching targets for ourselves. we are using data to better understand the challenges we face and to hold ourselves to account and monitor own our progress or lack of it. we hope that by doing this, while recognising that we are not perfect, we can set an example for the firms that we regulate and encourage conversation and action. in 2019, despite no mandatory requirement to do so, we published details of our ethnicity pay gap. this year, we broke that down further to recognise that the grouping of bame people\u00a0masks some important underlying differences between ethnicities. we also published our intersectional ethnicity-gender pay gap. one of the joys and challenges of working at the fca is that you get to wear a lot of hats \u2013 at least metaphorically. we are an employer, but of course we are also a regulator and a public body which delivers public value. so we have to look at d&i in financial services through these lenses too. how we regulate firms - culture as a regulator, we talk a lot about culture. we\u2019ve carried out substantial work around culture in financial services firms over the last few years. our starting point is that we want financial services firms to have healthy cultures that reduce the potential for harm to consumers and markets. leaders must acknowledge their status and actively recognise how their behaviour and actions can influence and support an environment of safety and collaboration. we fully recognise that our 60,000 firm population is very broad culturally, but there are some common elements. healthy cultures are purposeful and safe and they support environments that are diverse and inclusive. safe cultures in turn play a key role in supporting inclusion by enabling employees to bring their whole selves to work. in practice, this means creating an environment where employees feel safe to share ideas and speak up. a key part of this is making sure leaders and the organisation listen up. leaders must acknowledge their status and actively recognise how their behaviour and actions can influence and support an environment of safety and collaboration. when employees do speak out, the response of an organisation is key to determining whether they or their colleagues will feel safe to do so again. without this safety - without an inclusive culture - the value of diversity will be lost. firms cannot create true cognitive diversity without inclusion. as i have said, when it comes to culture and diversity and inclusion, there is no one size fits all, and it would be inappropriate for the fca to mandate particular cultures. however, we do expect firms to be able to articulate their purpose, to talk about how their governance structures drive good decision making, to set an appropriate tone from the top, and to be able to show that their people policies are effective in driving diversity and inclusion. and i might as well come clean and say there is no rule in our handbook that says regulated firms have to be diverse or even have an internal or external diversity policy. but that doesn\u2019t mean we are silent or powerless. d&i is relevant to so much of what we do \u2013 it is relevant not just to culture, people and leadership; it is relevant to integrity, to treating customers fairly, to pricing structures, to marketing and advertising, to environmental, social and governance (esg) strategies and so on. and we have a range of tools at our disposal, from formal to informal and in particular, we have a unique power to influence and convene \u2013 to get people round that dinner party table. our responsibilities as a public body so perhaps what i am saying is that getting d&i right is a virtuous chain of events: when we get it right as an employer, it helps us to get regulation of firms right \u2013 whether that\u2019s as a supervisor or as a policy maker. as a public body delivering public value, we are subject to the public sector equality duty, which means that we must encourage diversity and inclusion in carrying out all of our functions. what this means in practice is that there are opportunities for us to consider our public sector equality duty in all of our interactions with financial services firms: from how we break down diversity barriers to entry into the industry to how we look at the composition of boards and executives, including in smr interviews how we ensure that we are considering the impact of our policy and competition work on different consumer groups and the conversations we have with firms in our supervisory and enforcement work whenever we make new rules, we carry out an equality impact assessment (eia) as\u00a0part of our process to ensure groups with protected characteristics are not\u00a0disadvantaged by our policies and that we have fully considered how we can make policy for a diverse population. getting this right is an important part of the policy making process and it cannot be a tick box or an afterthought \u2013 it has to be\u00a0an integral part of the process, and, to bring us right back to where i started, with us an employer, a diverse employee base is an asset in making this happen. a good example of this, is our work on overdrafts. this was not a straightforward piece of policy, it involved balanced and careful judgements. we listened to consumers through extensive consumer research. we collected extensive data to help us determine who would be impacted by our work and how and used that to make judgments. we wanted a solution that would enable firms to continue to offer different overdraft products, where this is in consumers\u2019 interests, while competing meaningfully on price, to make sure no one had their access removed, so we talked to firms too. when you make an intervention like this, there is a risk that not everybody is going to benefit. in this case, our specific concerns were for some of the most vulnerable and low-income customers, who were paying very high fees and charges through expensive unarranged overdrafts. a more diverse and inclusive workforce allows us to take a more holistic approach like this and not just in our policy work. and of course, we too have to create a culture of safety so that we listen to voices from different backgrounds as we go about our day to day work of regulation. so perhaps what i am saying is that getting d&i right is a virtuous chain of events: when we get it right as an employer, it helps us to get regulation of firms right \u2013 whether that\u2019s as a supervisor or as a policy maker. that directly impacts the firms we regulate, who - if they are diverse themselves - are more likely to design products and services in an inclusive way and reach a diverse customer base. what you might call a win win. \n\n\t\t\t\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n    \n    \n          \n       \n                  \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   was this page helpful? \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       \n     radios \n   \n   \n             \n  \n  \n  \n\n       yes  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n\n       no  \n  \n  \n   \n\n           \n       what can we do to improve pages like this?\t \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       what did you find helpful? \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   submit feedback"},

5% of the total. and where there are directors of colour they tend to be concentrated in a small number of firms and few hold the positions of ceo or chair. the number of women of colour in senior positions in financial services is a particular concern. this lack of diversity at the top raises questions about firms\u2019 ability to understand the different communities they serve, and their different needs. this lack of diversity at the top raises questions about firms\u2019 ability to understand the different communities they serve, and their different needs. our  financial lives research  shows black, asian and minority ethnic adults are disproportionately represented among the growing number of vulnerable consumers \u2013 and so at greater risk of financial harm. women are less likely than men to have the savings needed to weather financial hardship and their employment tends to be more precarious. during the pandemic, the unpaid  burden borne by women  has increased, with women reporting they are doing 64% more housework than men and that their childcare responsibilities have doubled. the fawcett society  has shown the impact of the pandemic to be particularly acute for ethnic minority women. they are more worried about debt and less likely than white men or women to be able to make ends meet. ethnic minority women are working more \u2013 both paid and unpaid \u2013 and are more anxious about work. perhaps unsurprising when you consider that black african and black caribbean people are overrepresented in front-line health and social care roles. in our recent guidance on vulnerability, we said that firms \u2013 all firms \u2013 needed to understand the needs of their customers and be able to respond to them through product design, flexible consumer service and communications. i would question if any firm can adequately respond to the needs of these consumers if they do not have the diversity of background and experience required to overcome biases and blind spots. i would question if any firm can adequately respond to the needs of these consumers if they do not have the diversity of background and experience required to overcome biases and blind spots. ultimately, improving diversity and inclusion is both a matter of fairness and a crucial way to strengthen consumer outcomes. as a public body, we are subject to the public sector equality duty and have responsibilities both as an employer and as a regulator. we are working with the prudential regulation authority to formalise our regulatory approach to diversity and inclusion under that duty and our objectives - and then to make our expectations clear. holding firms to account as part of our work on wholesale banking culture, we introduced 5 conduct questions to help focus minds of senior managers on conduct risk. i would like to see this expanded \u2013 and a sixth added \u2013 for all firms: is your management team diverse enough to provide adequate challenge and do you create the right environment in which people of all backgrounds can speak up? this is much broader than representation. it is about a firm\u2019s culture. not just in relation to diversity, but inclusion, too. do people feel comfortable in the work environment such that they can demonstrate, share and bring to bear their diversity of experience and background? in the years ahead, if we don\u2019t see improvements in diversity at senior levels and better answers, we will also consider how to best use our powers. this is something we will consider over the next year, in work led by georgina philippou, until recently the fca\u2019s chief operating officer. there are supervisory tools we can draw on. for example, i want to consider whether the diversity of management teams \u2013 and the inclusivity of the management culture they create \u2013 could be part of our consideration of senior manager applications. we also need to look hard at the way capital markets work. in the us, we have seen the nasdaq take the lead with its listing rules, which will require all companies listed on its us exchange to have, or explain why they do not have, at least two diverse directors. as part of our regulatory work on diversity and inclusion and the listings framework, we will be exploring whether we should make similar requirements part of our premium listing rules. as part of our regulatory work on diversity and inclusion and the listings framework, we will be exploring whether we should make similar requirements part of our premium listing rules. many investors are already taking the lead in this area. one leading investment bank will only underwrite ipos in the us and europe where the company listing has at least one diverse board member. they said they would raise this target to two diverse candidates for each ipo client next year. i would encourage all capital markets participants to consider the reasons why there are so few female ceos and cfos or ceos and cfos of colour presenting during ipos or when capital is being raised \u2013 are there challenges in the culture of private equity, underwriting, equity syndication?\u00a0what more can we do to sponsor and celebrate female business leaders and entrepreneurs? as an employer, we are determined to improve our own diversity and to work on our culture to ensure it is inclusive. as a regulator, we want the same from the firms we oversee and in the markets we regulate. not because it is a social good \u2013 although, frankly, that should be enough. we care because diversity reduces conduct risk and those firms that fail to reflect society run the risk of poorly serving diverse communities. and, at that point, diversity and inclusion become regulatory issues. \n\n\t\t\t\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n    \n    \n          \n       \n                  \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   was this page helpful? \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       \n     radios \n   \n   \n             \n  \n  \n  \n\n       yes  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n\n       no  \n  \n  \n   \n\n           \n       what can we do to improve pages like this?\t \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       what did you find helpful? \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   submit feedback"},

'this research has helped us better understand what drives and motivates consumers so we can tell them about the risks involved in these investments through our investment harm campaign. 'we want to make sure that we encourage the ability to save and invest for lifetime events, particularly for younger generations, but it is imperative that consumers do so with savings and investment products that have a suitable level of risk for their needs. investors need to be mindful of their overall risk appetite, diversifying their investments and only investing money they can afford to lose in high risk products. 'we also hope our research\u00a0will\u00a0provide valuable insights\u00a0for other organisations\u00a0that are involved in tackling harm in this market.' the research shows that investors often have high confidence and claimed knowledge. however, it also shows a lack of awareness and/or belief in the risks of investing, with over 4 in 10 not viewing \u2018losing some money\u2019 as one of the risks of investing, even though as with most investments their whole capital is at risk. in some cases, investors can lose more than they initially invested for example with contract for difference investments. these investors also have a strong reliance on gut instinct and rules of thumb, with almost four in five (78%) agreeing \u201ci trust my instincts to tell me when it\u2019s time to buy and to sell\u201d and 78% also agreeing \u201cthere are certain investment types, sectors or companies i consider a \u2018safe bet\u2019\u201d. research findings indicate that this newer audience has a more diverse set of characteristics than traditional investors. they tend to skew more towards being female, under 40 and from a bame background. this newer group of self-investors are more reliant on contemporary media (e.g. youtube, social media) for tips and news. this trend appears to be prompted by the accessibility offered by new investment apps. these younger investors may have the lowest levels of financial resilience making them more vulnerable to investment loss. research showed that a significant loss could have a fundamental lifestyle impact on 59% of self-directed investors with less than 3 years' experience, who are more likely to own high risk investment products, compared with 38% of investors with greater than 3 years\u2019 experience. tackling harm in the consumer investment market is a priority for the fca. the fca commissioned britainthinks to conduct in-depth research into self-directed investors\u2019 behaviours, attitudes and financial resilience. together with feedback from its call for input on the consumer investment market, this research will underpin the fca's work in the consumer investment market. in particular, the research will help design a new campaign to address the harm caused from consumers investing in high risk, high return, illiquid investments that may not be suitable for their needs. alongside the publication of this research, the fca has today launched its digital disruption campaign to prevent investment harm. the campaign uses online advertising to disrupt investors\u2019 journeys and drive them to the high return investments webpage \u2013 which covers key questions consumers should ask before investing. the fca advises consumers to consider five important questions before they invest:\u00a0 am i comfortable with the level of risk? do i fully understand the investment being offered to me? am i protected if things go wrong? are my investments regulated? should i get financial advice? the fca has recently  published  work to tackle consumer harm in the investment market including banning the mass-marketing of speculative mini-bonds and will set out its further plans later this year. the regulator also published a  warning to consumers  on the dangers of investments advertising high returns based on cryptoassets. notes to editors understanding self-directed investors  research report . the project was conducted with britainthinks, an international insight and strategy consultancy. the research surveyed 517 self-directed investors and was conducted 18th august 2020 \u2013 20th january 2021. for the purposes of the report the fca defines self-directed investors as those who are making investment decisions on their own behalf,\u00a0i.e.\u00a0selecting investment types and making trades themselves rather than seeking financial advice.\u00a0\u00a0 in september the fca issued a  call for input on the consumer investment market , asking for comment on how consumer protection can be improved. responses to this are under review and the fca has already acted to ban the mass-marketing of speculative illiquid securities (including speculative mini-bonds) to retail investors. read a  summary  of our work to tackle consumer harm in the investment market, between 1 january and 31 october 2020. investment harms consumer  webpage . the fca is  examining  intergenerational differences in the financial needs and circumstances of each generation which has been  updated  to reflect the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. protecting vulnerable consumers is a key focus for the fca. our  business plan  for 2020/21 states that we will focus on making sure that the most vulnerable are protected. find out more information  about the fca . \n\t\t\t\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n    \n    \n          \n       \n                  \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   was this page helpful?

{"header": "dfsa sanctions upheld against dr mubashir sheikh for serious misconduct", "date": "29 nov 2020, 02:44 pm", "text": "the financial markets tribunal ( fmt ) has upheld enforcement action taken by the dubai financial services authority ( dfsa ) against dr mubashir ahmed sheikh for serious misconduct including misleading and deceptive behaviour. following a five-day hearing in april of this year, the fmt issued its decision on 20 october upholding the dfsa\u2019s findings and imposing the following sanctions: a fine of usd225,000; a direction that dr sheikh pay restitution of at least usd644,836 to mas clearsight ltd (mas) representing the cash he had previously withdrawn in a deceptive way, along with interest; a prohibition from holding office in or being an employee of certain dfsa-regulated entities; and, a restriction from performing any function in connection with the provision of financial services in or from the difc. dr sheikh was the chairman, senior executive officer and majority beneficial owner of mas, formerly a dfsa authorised firm which has been in liquidation since november 2015. \u00a0 as publicised in the  dfsa\u2019s media release, dated 3 october 2019 , the dfsa decided to take action against dr sheikh for breaches of dfsa legislation. \u00a0 dr sheikh disputed the dfsa\u2019s findings and referred the action to the fmt for review. \u00a0the fmt is a specialist tribunal, operationally independent of the dfsa, which has its own rules of procedure. \u00a0the fmt conducts a full merits review of dfsa decisions that are referred to it and determines the appropriate action for the dfsa to take.\u00a0 the restitution direction is the first ever imposed on an individual, and the fine is the highest imposed on an individual. \u00a0in addition, the fmt ordered dr sheikh to pay usd15,000 towards the dfsa\u2019s costs. the fmt imposed the action on dr sheikh because it found that he:\u00a0 demonstrated a lack of integrity by knowingly acting dishonestly and deceptively;\u00a0 knowingly provided false, misleading or deceptive information to the dfsa; and\u00a0 knowingly caused mas to breach the dfsa\u2019s prudential rules. \u00a0 the key facts and findings of the case include: in early 2015, dr sheikh\u2019s company (mas) was in an increasingly weak financial position, and required to report its financial position to the dfsa on a monthly basis, in particular as to whether it was maintaining its regulatory capital of usd600,000; in may and june 2015, dr sheikh withdrew over usd512,000 in cash from mas\u2019 bank account, depleting almost all of its liquid assets, and causing mas to breach its regulatory capital requirement; by concealing his cash withdrawals and knowingly providing false information about them within mas, dr sheikh knowingly caused mas, via its finance officer, to misreport its regulatory capital position to the dfsa; when the dfsa became aware of the true position in june 2015, it promptly suspended mas\u2019 licence, to protect users of financial services in the difc. \u00a0subsequently in 2015, mas entered into liquidation with significant outstanding debts including unpaid employee entitlements; in an attempt to defend his misconduct, dr sheikh repeatedly, over the course of several years, provided the dfsa and the fmt with an elaborate and improbable version of events. \u00a0this included false claims that dr sheikh withdrew the cash initially to pay investors as part of an investment deal, and later when the deal fell through to pay other legitimate debtors, which claims he tried to support with fabricated documents and false witness testimony. in its decision, the fmt described dr sheikh\u2019s misconduct as a \u201c dishonest set of steps aggravated by devious acts to try to conceal and cover up over a long period \u201d. \u00a0the fmt also found that dr sheikh knew full well that his withdrawals had been causing mas to breach its regulatory capital requirement \u201c because his story of the deal is a lie \u201d. bryan stirewalt, chief executive of the dfsa, said: \"the dfsa has zero tolerance for individuals who deliberately mislead and attempt to deceive the regulator, particularly where an individual takes such elaborate and dishonest steps to conceal their conduct. such individuals will be held accountable to the fullest degree of the law, and they have no place in the difc. the dfsa will also require, where appropriate, wrongdoers to compensate those who have suffered losses arising from their misconduct. individuals in control of financial services firms must manage the firm\u2019s finances responsibly, in the interest of all stakeholders including employees, and act with integrity at all times.\" the fmt refused dr sheikh permission to appeal its decision to the difc court. \u00a0dr sheikh did not file an application to the difc courts for permission to appeal against the fmt\u2019s decision and, therefore, the fmt\u2019s decision is final. \u00a0 the fmt's decision can be found on the fmt section of the dfsa website, and a copy of it can be accessed via this link. \u00a0information about pending fmt matters, including details of any public hearings, can be found via the same  link ."},
