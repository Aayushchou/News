thank you. good afternoon. before i take questions, i want to make \u2014 give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the american people. first, on vaccinations: on december 8th, i indicated that i hoped to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days. we met that goal last week by day 58 \u2014 42 days ahead of schedule. now, today, i\u2019m setting a second goal, and that is: we will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people\u2019s arms. that\u2019s right: 200 million shots in 100 days. i know it\u2019s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close \u2014 not even close \u2014 to what we are doing. and i believe we can do it. and today, we\u2019ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities \u2014 as a consequence of the virus \u2014 by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them. i also set a goal, before i took office, of getting a majority of schools in k through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders \u2014 a recent department of education department survey shows that nearly half of the k-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. not yet a majority, but we\u2019re really close. and i believe, in the 35 days left to go, we\u2019ll meet that goal as well. as of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people\u2019s bank accounts. that\u2019s real money in people\u2019s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. and millions more will be getting their money very soon. one final note: since we passed the american rescue plan, we\u2019re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. since it was passed, a majority \u2014 a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that\u2019s going to take place this year. they\u2019re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent \u2014 a 6 percent growth in gdp. and just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. that\u2019s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high. so there are still too many americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do. but i can say to you, the american people: help is here, and hope is on the way. now i\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. zeke, the associated press. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president. you mentioned your progress on covid-19. i\u2019d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. one of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. all of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from republicans on capitol hill. how far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the american people? the president: well, i\u2019m going to \u2014 look, when i took office, i decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: i got elected to solve problems. and the most urgent problem facing the american people, i stated from the outset, was covid-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of americans. and so that\u2019s why i put all my focus in the beginning \u2014 there are a lot of problems \u2014 put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems. and the other problems we\u2019re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they\u2019ve been around a long time. and what we\u2019re going to be able to do, god willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and \u2014 whether it\u2019s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country. but the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they\u2019re going to lose a family member, whether they\u2019re going to be in a position where they\u2019re not going to be \u2014 they\u2019re going to lose their home because they can\u2019t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to \u2014 to pay their rent. so we\u2019re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. but that\u2019s the reason why i focused as i have. and here\u2019s the deal: i think my republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to \u2014 is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. but i\u2019m not going to do that; i\u2019m just going to move forward and take these things as they come. q\u00a0 and just to \u2014 to follow up, mr. president, can your presidency be a success if you can\u2019t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights? the president: well, i plan on making progress on all of them, but that\u2019s going to be for the american people to decide. i think \u2014 you know, i doubt whether \u2014 maybe you did; maybe others did. i thought \u2014 many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan i got passed, passed, without any republican votes. a pretty big deal. it got passed. growing the economy. people\u2019s lives are changing. so let\u2019s see what happens. all i know, i\u2019ve been hired to solve problems \u2014 to solve problems, not create division. okay. how about yamiche? q\u00a0 thanks so much, mr. president. you\u2019ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn\u2019t come to this country right now; this isn\u2019t the time to come. that message is not being received. instead, the perception of you that got you elected \u2014 as a moral, decent man \u2014 is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors. how do you resolve that tension? and how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with title 42, there are some families that are staying? and is there a timeline for when we won\u2019t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with \u2014 run by cpb [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors? the president: well, look, i guess i should be flattered people are coming because i\u2019m the nice guy; that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s happening \u2014 that i\u2019m a decent man or however it\u2019s phrased. that \u2014 you know, that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming, because they know biden is a good guy. the truth of the matter is: nothing has changed. as many people came \u2014 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of \u2014 in 2019, before the pandemic, in the trump administration. it happens every single, solitary year: there is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of january, february, march. that happens every year. in addition to that, there is a \u2014 and nobody \u2014 and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? that\u2019s not the reason they\u2019re coming. the reason they\u2019re coming is that it\u2019s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. number two, they\u2019re coming because of the circumstances in-country \u2014 in-country. the way to deal with this problem \u2014 and i started to deal with it back when i was a united states senator \u2014 i mean, vice president \u2014 putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving. what did trump do? he eliminated that funding. he didn\u2019t use it. he didn\u2019t do it. and in addition to that, what he did \u2014 he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and \u2014 and has been \u2014 continued to be a problem for a long time. he, in fact, shut down the \u2014 the number of beds available. he did not fund hhs to get people to get the children out of those \u2014 those border patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days \u2014 a little while. but he dismantled all of that. and so what we\u2019re doing now is attempting to rebuild \u2014 rebuild the system that can accommodate the \u2014 what is happening today. and i like to think it\u2019s because i\u2019m a nice guy, but it\u2019s not. it\u2019s because of what\u2019s happened every year. let me say one other thing on this. if you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back \u2014 are being sent back. thousands \u2014 tens of thousands of people who are \u2014 who are over 18 years of age and single \u2014 people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home. we\u2019re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. we\u2019re trying to work out now, with mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. but we \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. they\u2019re not getting across the border. and those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we\u2019re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as i said. for example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. we\u2019re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers\u2019 arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. less than \u2014 i think it\u2019s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young. so what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the border patrol facilities, which no child \u2014 no one should be in any longer than 72 hours. and today, i went to \u2014 for example, i used all the resources available to me, went to the defense department, and \u2014 and the secretary of defense has just made available fort bliss \u2014 5,000 beds be made easily available. five thousand beds on the texas border. so we\u2019re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that trump dismantled. it\u2019s going to take time. and the other thing we\u2019re doing, i might add \u2014 am i giving you too long an answer? because if you don\u2019t want the details \u2014 q\u00a0 (inaudible.) the president: no, no, but i mean \u2014 i don\u2019t know how much detail you want about immigration. maybe i\u2019ll stop there and fin- \u2014 q\u00a0 my follow-up question is: one, if you could talk a little bit about which families \u2014 why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. the families that are being allowed to stay, why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. and in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what zeke was asking about, there\u2019s \u2014 immigration is a big issue, of course, when it \u2014 related to the filibuster, but there\u2019s also republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. chuck schumer is calling it an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to democracy. why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration? jim clyburn, someone who \u2014 of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights. the president: well, look, i\u2019m going to deal with all of those problems. the question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate. let\u2019s go to the first question you asked \u2014 the first of the second question you asked. and that is: what about dealing with families? why are not \u2014 some not going back? because mexico is refusing to take them back. they\u2019re saying they won\u2019t take them back \u2014 not all of them. we\u2019re in negotiations with the president of mexico. i think we\u2019re going to see that change. they should all be going back, all be going back. the only people we\u2019re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the rio grande by themselves with no help are children. and what we\u2019re doing there, and it\u2019s an important point to understand \u2014 i know you understand; i don\u2019t mean to say it that way \u2014 an important point to focus on: the vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to united states come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the united states \u2014 a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop. what was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. well, we\u2019ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there\u2019s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. and then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. they\u2019re establishing that right off the bat. if it, in fact, is mom or dad, dad says \u2014 to take the extreme case \u2014 \u201ci got a birth certificate.\u201d then guess what? we\u2019re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately. and so that\u2019s going to reduce significantly \u2014 there\u2019s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a border patrol station. one is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. the second way to do it is put them in a health and human services facility that we\u2019re occupying now \u2014 both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like fort bliss \u2014 to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined. q\u00a0 and can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)? the president: filibuster. filibuster. you know, with regard to the filibuster, i believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when i came to the united states senate 120 years ago. and that is that \u2014 it used to be required for the filibuster \u2014 and i had a card on this; i was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them \u2014 that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 \u2014 the filibuster existed \u2014 there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. last year alone, there were five times that many. so it\u2019s being abused in a gigantic way. and, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. and guess what? people got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote. so i strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are \u2014 are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote \u2014 like the basic right to vote. we\u2019ve amended the filibuster in the past. but here\u2019s the deal: as you observed, i\u2019m a fairly practical guy. i want to get things done. i want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the american people. and in order to do that in a 50-50 senate, we\u2019ve got to get to the place where i get 50 votes so that the vice president of the united states can break the tie, or i get 51 votes without her. and so, i\u2019m going to say something outrageous: i have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the united states senate. so the best way to get something done, if you \u2014 if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to \u2014 anyway \u2014 i \u2014 we\u2019re going to get a lot done. and if we have to \u2014 if there\u2019s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we\u2019ll have to go beyond what i\u2019m talking about. okay. hang on. sorry. oh, seung min \u2014 ms. kim. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president, to follow up on the filibuster: so do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51? the president: (laughs.) if we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. you\u2019re going to have to \u2014 the existing rule \u2014 it\u2019s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster. but it\u2019s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. but our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re going to do about the filibuster. let me get here. okay, cecilia vega. \u00a0 q\u00a0 i\u2019d like to circle back to immigration, please. you just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. sir, i just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where i met nine-year-old, yossell, who walked here from honduras by himself, along with another little boy. he had that phone number on him \u2014 the president: astounding. q\u00a0 \u2014 and we were able to call his family. his mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. that\u2019s why she sent him alone from honduras. so, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging \u2014 in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process \u2014 encouraging families like yossell says to come? the president: well, look, the idea that i\u2019m going to say \u2014 which i would never do \u2014 \u201cif an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we\u2019re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side\u201d \u2014\u00a0no previous administration did that either, except trump. i\u2019m not going to do it. i\u2019m not going to do it. that\u2019s why i\u2019ve asked the vice president of the united states, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave honduras, guatemala, and el salvador in the first place. it\u2019s because of earthquakes, floods. it\u2019s because of lack of food. it\u2019s because of gang violence. it\u2019s because of a whole range of things. that \u2014 when i was vice president and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, i was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like \u2014 in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn\u2019t walk in the street because they were getting \u2014 their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence. well, what i was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but i was able to say, \u201cokay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? i\u2019ll put the lighting in.\u201d we got a contractor. we got the type of lighting. we paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. and violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. fewer people sought to leave. when this hurricane occurred \u2014 two hurricanes \u2014 instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn\u2019t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. we\u2019re going to do a lot in our administration. we\u2019re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place. that mother did not sit around with \u2014 on the kitchen table and say, \u201cyou know, i got a great idea: the way i\u2019m going to make sure my son get taken care of is i\u2019m going to put a\u2026\u201d \u2014 how old was he, or she? q\u00a0 he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s nine. i also met a 10-year-old. the president: a nine-year-old. \u201ci\u2019m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the united states because i know joe biden is a nice guy and he\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d what a desperate act to have to take. the circumstances must be horrible. so we can do something about that. that\u2019s what the vice president is going to be doing: what i did. when president obama asked me to come and deal, i was in \u2014 i was in turkey at the time, and he said, \u201cyou got to come home and take care of this.\u201d so we put together a plan and it had an impact. and so, the question here is whether \u2014 how we go ahead and do this; what we do. there\u2019s no easy answer q\u00a0 a quick follow, if i may. \u00a0do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually? the president: well, the judgment has to be made whether or not \u2014 and in this young man\u2019s case, he has a mom at home; there\u2019s an overwhelming reason why he\u2019d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom. q\u00a0 final follow, sir. you mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. the customs and border protection facility in donna, texas \u2014 i was there \u2014 is at 1,556 percent capacity \u2014 the president: yep. q\u00a0 \u2014 right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. there are kids that are sleeping on floors. they are packed into these pods. i\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who say that they \u2014 some of these children have not seen the sun in days. what\u2019s your reaction \u2014 what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? is what\u2019s happening inside acceptable to you? and when is this going to be fixed? the president: is \u2014 that\u2019s a serious question, right? is it acceptable to me? come on. that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. that\u2019s why i got fort bliss opened up. that\u2019s why i\u2019ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely \u2014 not just children, but particularly children \u2014 to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what\u2019s happening. that is totally unacceptable. ken. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president. i wanted to ask you about afghanistan. you face a may 1st deadline for the withdrawal of u.s. troops from that country. as a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. can you commit to the american people that by may 2nd the u.s. will no longer have forces in afghanistan? the president: the answer is that it\u2019s going to be hard to meet the may 1 deadline. just in terms of tactical reasons, it\u2019s hard to get those troops out. so, what we\u2019ve been doing \u2014 what i\u2019ve been doing and what secretary blinken has been doing \u2014 has been \u2014 we\u2019ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have nato allies who have troops in afghanistan as well. and if we leave, we\u2019re going to do so in a safe and orderly way. we\u2019re in consultation, i said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. and secretary blinken is meeting in brussels this week with our nato allies, particularly those who have forces there. and general austin is \u2014 just met with ghani and i\u2019m waiting for the briefing on that. he is the \u2014 the \u201cleader,\u201d quote, in afghanistan and kabul. and there\u2019s a u.n.-led process that\u2019s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people \u2014 how to end this war. but it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. but the question is: how and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by president trump to leave under a deal that looks like it\u2019s not being able to be worked out to begin with? how is that done? but we are not staying a long time. q\u00a0 you just said \u201cif we leave.\u201d do you think it\u2019s possible that we\u2013 the president: we will leave. the question is when we leave. q\u00a0 do you \u2014 sorry \u2014 do you believe, though, it\u2019s possible we could have troops there next year? the president: i \u2014 i can\u2019t picture that being the case. okay. kristen. q\u00a0 thank you very much, mr. president. given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the u.s. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward? the president: i will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well. q\u00a0 how soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? we\u2019ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven\u2019t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the american people a chance to see that. will you commit to transparency on this issue, mr. president? the president: i will commit to transparency, and \u2014 as soon as i am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now. and one of the reasons i haven\u2019t gone down \u2014 i have all my \u2014 my chief folks have gone down \u2014 is i don\u2019t want to become the issue. i don\u2019t want to be, you know, bringing all of the secret service and everybody with me to get in the way. so this is being set up, and you\u2019ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving. q\u00a0 okay. and just to be clear: how soon will that be, mr. president? the president: i don\u2019t know, to be clear. q\u00a0 okay. and do you bear responsibility for everything that\u2019s happening at the border now? i hear you talking a lot about the past administration. you decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies? the president: to roll back what? i\u2019m sorry. q\u00a0 did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor? the president: first of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all \u2014 did not slow up the amount of immigration \u2014 and there\u2019s many people coming. and rolling back the policies of separating children from \u2014 from their mothers, i make no apology for that. rolling back the policies of \u201cremain in mexico,\u201d sitting on the edge of the rio grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and \u2014 i make no apologies for that. i make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. and so, i make no apologies for that. q\u00a0 if i could just ask you about foreign policy, mr. president. overnight, we learned that north korea tested two ballistic missiles. what, if any, actions will you take? and what is your red line on north korea? the president: let me say that, number one, u.n. resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested \u2014 number one. we\u2019re consulting with our allies and partners. and there will be responses \u2014 if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly. but i\u2019m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now: consulting with our allies. q\u00a0 just a very quick follow-up \u2014 the president: you\u2019ve only got another hour now, okay? q\u00a0 diplomacy: can you define what you mean? and former president obama warned the incoming president trump that north korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. is that how you assess the crisis in north korea? the president: yes. okay. hang on a second here, kristen. nancy, cbs. q \u00a0thank you very much, mr. president. i want to go back to voting rights. and as yamiche mentioned, republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters \u2014 the very people who helped to get you elected in november. are you worried that if you don\u2019t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the house and the senate in 2022? the president: what i\u2019m worried about is how un-american this whole initiative is. it\u2019s sick. it\u2019s sick. deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you\u2019re going to end voting at five o\u2019clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances. it\u2019s all designed \u2014 and i\u2019m going to spend my time doing three things: one, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the house, number one. number two, educating the american public. the republican voters i know find this despicable. republican voters, the folks out in \u2014 outside this white house. i\u2019m not talking about the elected officials; i\u2019m talking about voters. voters. and so i am convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. this makes jim crow look like jim eagle. i mean, this is gigantic what they\u2019re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained. i\u2019m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the house and the senate, to keep that from \u2014 from becoming the law. q\u00a0 is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation? the president: the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d but i\u2019m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now. q\u00a0 and then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? you haven\u2019t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time. the president: (laughs.) my predecessor need do [sic] \u2014 needed to. my predecessor. oh god, i miss him. q\u00a0 have you \u2014 have you \u2014 the president: no, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d my plan is to run for reelection. that\u2019s my expectation. q\u00a0 and then, on \u2014 on one other note, on bipartisanship: your old friend, mitch mcconnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. do you see it the same way he does? have you rejected bipartisanship? the president: no, i haven\u2019t at all. i\u2019ve been meeting \u2014 when is the last time a president invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? everything from how we work \u2014 we\u2019re working with a group of 20 members of the senate right now and house on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. and we\u2019re working together on a bunch of things. but, look, i know mitch well; mitch knows me well. i would expect mitch to say exactly what he said. but this is a matter of making sure that \u2014 i would like republican \u2014 elected republican support, but what i know i have now is that i have electoral support from republican voters. republican voters agree with what i\u2019m doing. and so, unless mitch says the last thing i did is \u2014 the last piece of legislation is so far left \u2014 well, then he ought to a look at his party. over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what i did. okay. where am i here? let me see. kaitlan. q\u00a0 thank you very much, mr. president. i have a question for you, but first i\u2019d like to follow up on a question from yamiche, and that\u2019s on the filibuster. the president: that counts as a question, but go ahead. q\u00a0 okay. i\u2019ll make it quick. it\u2019s a quick question. the president: no, no \u2014 you can. q\u00a0 regarding the filibuster: at john lewis\u2019s funeral, president barack obama said he believed the filibuster was a \u201crelic\u201d of the jim crow era. do you agree? the president: yes. q\u00a0 and if not, why not abolish it if it\u2019s a relic of the jim crow era? the president: successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. let\u2019s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. it\u2019s been abused from the time it came into being \u2014 by an extreme way in the last 20 years. let\u2019s deal with the abuse first. q\u00a0 it sounds like you\u2019re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. is that correct? the president: i answered your question. q\u00a0 you also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection. the president: i said, \u201cthat is my expectation.\u201d q\u00a0 so is that a \u201cyes\u201d that you are running for reelection? the president: look, i \u2014 i don\u2019t know where you guys come from, man. i\u2019ve never been able to travel. i\u2019m a great respecter of fate. i\u2019ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain. q\u00a0 and if you do \u2014 the president: it \u2014 q\u00a0 if you do run, will vice president harris be on your ticket? the president: i would fully expect that to be the case. she\u2019s doing a great job. she\u2019s a great partner. she\u2019s a great partner. q\u00a0 and do you believe you\u2019ll be running against former president trump? the president: oh, come on. i don\u2019t even think about \u2014 i don\u2019t \u2014 i have no idea. i have no idea if there will be a republican party. do you? i know you don\u2019t have to answer my question, but, i mean, you know, do you? i mean, look, this is \u2014 the way i view things \u2014 i\u2019ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. i set a goal that\u2019s in front of me to get things done for the people i care most about, which are hardworking, decent american people who are getting \u2014 really having it stuck to them. i want to change the paradigm. i want to change the paradigm. we start to reward work, not just wealth. i want to change the paradigm. if you notice \u2014 don\u2019t you find it kind of interesting that my republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had \u2014 if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it \u2014 in dealing with the \u2014 the act that we just passed which puts money in people\u2019s pockets \u2014 ordinary people. did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion trump tax cut \u2014 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? did you hear them talk about that all? i love the fact that they\u2019ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. it\u2019s kind of amazing. when the federal budget is saving people\u2019s lives, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea. when the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest americans \u2014 90 of the fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you\u2019re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is \u2014 something is wrong. their newfound concern. i\u2019m concerned \u2014 look, i meant what i said when i ran. and a lot of you still think i\u2019m wrong, and i respect that. i said, \u201ci\u2019m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the american political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country \u2014 the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. they built america, and unions built them.\u201d the third reason i said i was running was to unite the country. and, generically speaking, all of you said, \u201cno, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d well, i\u2019ve not been able to unite the congress, but i\u2019ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. we have to come together. we have to. so, from my perspective, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 to me, it\u2019s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people \u2014 just hardworking people. people get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have \u2014 make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether \u2014 since he didn\u2019t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. these are basic things. basic things. and i\u2019m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered republicans, by and large, share that \u2014 that same \u2014 that same view, that same sense of what is \u2014 you know, what\u2019s appropriate. justin. justin sink, bloomberg. q\u00a0 thanks, mr. president. i wanted to ask about your relationship with china now that you\u2019ve been in office for a couple months. there\u2019s obviously the meeting in alaska that was a little theatrical, and there\u2019s the continued human rights abuses. so, today, i\u2019m wondering: are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on china? are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? and would you consider cutting off u.s. investment or chinese access to international payment systems? the president: well, look, they\u2019re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with china really is about. i\u2019ve known xi jinping for a long time. allegedly, by the time i left office as vice president, i had spent more time with xi jinping than any world leader had, because president obama and the chinese president hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the president of the united states to spend time with the vice president of another country. but it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of china. so, i spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter \u2014 my interpreter and his \u2014 going into great detail. he is very, very straightforward. doesn\u2019t have a democratic \u2014 with a small \u201cd\u201d \u2014 bone in his body. but he\u2019s a smart, smart guy. he\u2019s one of the guys, like putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can\u2019t function in an ever \u2014 an ever-complex world. so, when i was elected and he called to congratulate me, i think to the surprise of the china experts who were \u2014 his people were on call as well as mine, listening \u2014 we had a two-hour conversation. for two hours. and we made several things clear to one another. i made it clear to him again what i\u2019ve told him in person on several occasions: that we\u2019re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition. two, that we\u2019ll have strong competition but we\u2019ll insist that china play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. thirdly, in order to compete effectively, i indicated that we\u2019re going to deal with china effectively, and we\u2019re going to need three things to do that. i tell him, our people. first, we\u2019re going to invest in american workers and american science. i said that all through the campaign and i say it again. and we\u2019re \u2014 and i\u2019m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the \u201860s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire gdp in pure research and investment in science. today, it\u2019s 0.7 percent. i\u2019m going to change that. we\u2019re going to change that. the future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. and so what i\u2019m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent. one of the reasons why i\u2019ve set up the \u2014 the  pab  [pcast] \u2014 the president\u2019s board with scientists and the like, again \u2014 is we\u2019re going to invest in medical research \u2014 cancer, alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, the things \u2014 industries of the future \u2014 artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. and we\u2019re going to make real investments. china is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future. the third \u2014 the second thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to reestablish our alliances. and i\u2019ve been very clear with him, it\u2019s not anti-chinese. and we\u2019ve talked about it. i want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this \u2014 as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we\u2019ve been going close to an hour. i\u2019m happy to go longer. but one of the things that i\u2019m going to be doing, i\u2019m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in europe and very shortly \u2014 i think within the next hour or so. i don\u2019t know the exact time. and earlier this month \u2014 and apparently it got the chinese\u2019s attention; that\u2019s not why i did it \u2014 i met with our allies and how we\u2019re going to hold china accountable in the region: australia, india, japan, and the united states \u2014 the so-called quad. because we have to have democracies working together. before too long, i\u2019m going to have \u2014 i\u2019m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. and so we\u2019re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold china accountable to follow the rules \u2014 to follow the rules \u2014 whether it relates to the south china sea or the north china sea, or their agreement made on taiwan, or a whole range of other things. and the third thing, and the thing that i admire about dealing with xi is he understands \u2014 he makes no pretense about not understanding what i\u2019m saying any more than i do him \u2014 i pointed out to him: no leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. and i said as \u2014 \u201cand, mr. president, as i\u2019ve told you before, americans value the notion of freedom. america values human rights. we don\u2019t always live up to our expectations, but it\u2019s a values system. we are founded on that principle. and as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we\u2019re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear \u2014 make it clear what\u2019s happening.\u201d and he understood that. i made it clear that no american president \u2014 at least one did \u2014 but no american president ever back down from speaking out of what\u2019s happening to the uighurs, what\u2019s happening in hong kong, what\u2019s happening in-country. that\u2019s who we are. the moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. it\u2019s who we are. so i see stiff competition with china. china has an overall goal, and i don\u2019t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. that\u2019s not going to happen on my watch because the united states are going to continue to grow and expand. q\u00a0 all right. just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? or \u2014 the president: no, that\u2019s not where i make the decision; that\u2019s where i make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. all on the same page. look, i predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? because that is what is at stake, not just with china. look around the world. we\u2019re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. will there be middle class? how will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? how will they do that? and are democracies equipped \u2014 because all the people get to speak \u2014 to compete? it is clear, absolutely clear \u2014 and most of the scholars i dealt with at penn agree with me around the country \u2014 that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. if you notice, you don\u2019t have russia talking about communism anymore. it\u2019s about an autocracy. demand decisions made by a leader of a country \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. we\u2019ve got to prove democracy works. q\u00a0 and, mr. president, sorry, i know you haven\u2019t had a chance to address the tragedies in georgia and colorado. you had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. wondering if you\u2019ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to capitol hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control. the president: all the above. it\u2019s a matter of timing. as you\u2019ve all observed, successful presidents \u2014 better than me \u2014 have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they\u2019re doing \u2014 order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done. the next major initiative is \u2014 and i\u2019ll be announcing it friday in pittsburgh, in detail \u2014 is to rebuild the infrastructure \u2014 both physical and technological infrastructure in this country \u2014 so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. really good-paying jobs. and some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great republican goal and initiative. i still think the majority of the american people don\u2019t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. i mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide. some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what\u2019s the first thing that businesses asked? \u201cwhat\u2019s the closest access to \u2014 access to an interstate highway? how far am i from a freight rail? is the water \u2014 is the water available? is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?\u201d all the things that relate to infrastructure. we have somewhere \u2014 i asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did \u2014 not for this, but for a longer discussion. we have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure \u2014 we have \u2014 we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. china is investing three times more in infrastructure than the united states is. bridges: more than one third of our bridges \u2014 231,000 of them \u2014 need repairs. some are physical safety risks or preservation work. one in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. that\u2019s 186,000 miles of highway. aviation: 20 percent of all flights \u2014 20 percent of all flights weren\u2019t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. six to ten million homes in america still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. we have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane. what are we doing? and, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and \u2014 to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells. so, i \u2014 i just find it frustrated \u2014 frustrating to talk about. last point i\u2019ll make on the infrastructure \u2014 and i apologize for spending more time on it, but \u2014 is that if you think about it, it\u2019s the place where we will be able to significantly increase american productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. but we can\u2019t build back to what they used to be. we have to build \u2014 the environment has \u2014 global warming has already done significant damage. the roads that used to be above the water level \u2014 didn\u2019t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was \u2014 now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. because it\u2019s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it. there\u2019s so much we can do. look at all of the schools in america. most of you live in the washington area now. but in your hometowns \u2014 i don\u2019t know where you\u2019re all from \u2014 how many schools where the kids can\u2019t drink the water out of the fountain? how many schools are still in the position where there\u2019s asbestos? how many schools in america we\u2019re sending our kids to don\u2019t have adequate ventilation? how many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can\u2019t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? it\u2019s amazing. so there\u2019s so much we can do that\u2019s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs. and i think that i got one more question here. janet from univision. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president. we, too, have been reporting at the border. and just like cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on monday, who were detained by cbp \u2014 had the phone number for their mother who lives in the u.s. \u00a0we have contacted the mother. that\u2019s the only way they know her kids are here because cbp, today, thursday, has not contacted that mother. so when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing? the president: well, they\u2019re already getting better, but they\u2019re going to get real \u2014 they\u2019ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we\u2019re going to hear of some people leaving, okay? we can get this done. we\u2019re going to get it done. i had a long meeting with the entire team and several cabinet-level officers the other night. we\u2019re going to be moving, within the next \u2014 within the next week, over 100,000 \u2014 i mean, 1,000 people out of the border patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. we\u2019re going to significantly ramp up. we\u2019re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at hhs \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of them doing other things \u2014 and move them into making those calls. we\u2019re in a \u2014 we\u2019re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done. but i admire the fact that you were down there; you\u2019re making the calls yourself. it\u2019s real. the next thing that has to happen though \u2014 as you well know has to happen \u2014 there have to be some certitude that this is the \u2014 actually mom, dad, or whomever. and there\u2019s ways to do that. there\u2019s ways to do that \u2014 a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? \u201cwhat was your dog\u2019s name?\u201d kind of a thing. i\u2019m being a bit facetious, but not really. and also seeking harder data, from dna to \u2014 to birth certificates, which takes longer.\u00a0 so, i want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible. q\u00a0 as you well know, treating the root cau- \u2014 causes in latin america doesn\u2019t change things overnight. how do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the u.s. when things will not get better in their countries right away? the president: well, i can\u2019t guarantee that. but i know, you know, that old thing: the journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step. you know as well as i do; you cover it: you have serious \u2014 it\u2019s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in guatemala \u2014 i mean, in \u2014 in somewhere in mexico or in guadalupe, saying, \u201ci got a great idea. let\u2019s sell everything we have. give it to a coyote. have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don\u2019t speak the language. won\u2019t that be fun? let\u2019s go.\u201d that\u2019s not how it happens. people don\u2019t want to leave. when my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the irish sea, expectation was: was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the united states of america? but they left because of what the brits had been doing. they were in real, real trouble. they didn\u2019t want to leave. but they had no choice. so you got \u2014 we can\u2019t \u2014 i can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019re going to solve everything, but i can guarantee we can make everything better. we can make it better. we can change the lives of so many people. and the other thing i want to point out to you and i hope you point out: i realize it\u2019s much more heart wrenching \u2014 and it is \u2014 to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. but you went down there, and you saw: the vast majority of these children \u2014 70 percent \u2014 are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. doesn\u2019t make it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make it good, bad, or indifferent. but the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these god-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night \u2014 and there\u2019s some; that\u2019s true. that\u2019s why we got to act. and yesterday, i asked my team \u2014 both the director of the two agencies, as well as others \u2014 i asked them what would they, in fact \u2014 and i asked their opinion because they\u2019re the experts \u2014 but i said, \u201cfocus on the most vulnerable immediately.\u201d but there\u2019s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can\u2019t be made in the first 48 hours and begin. q\u00a0 if i may ask one last question: have you had any talks with senate republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the house until the situation at the border has been resolved? the president: no, because i know they have to posture for a while. they sort of got to get it out of their system. this is a \u2014 but i\u2019m ready to work with any republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better. but, folks, i\u2019m going. thank you very, very much. i appreciate it. thank you.

24, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t", "date": "march 24, 2021", "text": "james s. brady press briefing room 12:33 p.m. edt \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 as you may know and now you will know, today is equal pay day.\u00a0 and we have two special guests from the council of economic advisers: chair cecilia rouse and member heather boushey. \u00a0 chair cecilia rouse recently served as the dean of the princeton school of public and international affairs.\u00a0 she is a renowned labor economist with expertise centered in the economics of education and equality.\u00a0 cecilia previously served as a member of the council of economic advisers in the obama-biden administration and on the national economic council in the clinton administration.\u00a0 she is the first african american and just the fourth woman to lead the cea in the last 74 years of its existence. \u00a0 heather is a longtime economic counselor to president biden and previously served as president and ceo of the washington center for equitable growth.\u00a0 an expert on the impact of structural inequities on economic growth, she served as the chief economist for secretary of state hillary clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential transition team, and as an economist for a range of think tanks and the congressional joint economic committee. \u00a0 they both have quite some resumes.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to turn it over to them.\u00a0 they will each make some brief remarks, and we\u2019ll be able to take a couple of questions.\u00a0 and they actually have a meeting with the vice president they\u2019ll have to get to shortly thereafter. \u00a0 so, with that, i will turn it over. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 good afternoon.\u00a0 it\u2019s actually \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a pleasure to be here today.\u00a0 so today is equal pay day \u2014 a day that is sym- \u2014 is a symbolic representation of how far into this year women must wor- \u2014 work to catch up to what men made in the previous year.\u00a0 \u00a0 women working fulltime, year round, are typically paid just 82 cents for every dollar paid to men.\u00a0 it\u2019s a reminder of the work that remains to be done to advance equity and ensure that all americans have the opportunity to reach their full potential.\u00a0 \u00a0 because of this gender gap, women lose thousands of dollars each year and hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime.\u00a0 the disparities are greater for black and hispanic women who earn 63 cents and 55 cents for every dollar that a white man earns.\u00a0 \u00a0 what does this mean?\u00a0 so a black woman must work around 19 months to earn what a white man would earn in one year.\u00a0 for a hispanic woman, that is almost 22 months.\u00a0 \u00a0 so what does this really mean?\u00a0 it means i shouldn\u2019t be standing here today in front of you, and, really, i should be here sometime in august.\u00a0 \u00a0 so what are we doing about it?\u00a0 president biden and vice president harris believe we must begin by passing the paycheck fairness act.\u00a0 this bill would be an important step towards ending pay discrimination through transparency and accountability for employers.\u00a0 \u00a0 they believe we must provide paid family and medical leave, make childcare more affordable, and build pipelines for training that enable women to access higher-paying jobs.\u00a0 \u00a0 they\u2019re also committed to raising pay for childcare workers, preschool teachers, home health aides, and others in the care economy; and taking additional steps to increase wages for american workers, such as raising the minimum wage and empowering workers to organize and collectively bargain, both of which are important to reducing the wage gap for women.\u00a0 \u00a0 we have made progress.\u00a0 my daughter is here today; she\u2019s downstairs.\u00a0 and when i was her age, the gender wage gap was about 60 percent, compared to 80 percent \u2014 82 percent today.\u00a0 that said, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u00a0 the biden-harris administration is working to make sure our daughters have the same opportunities that our sons do, and to make sure that every american is given a fair shot to get ahead in this country.\u00a0 \u00a0 these aren\u2019t simply women\u2019s issues.\u00a0 they affect all families, the ability of our economy to recover, and our nation\u2019s competitiveness.\u00a0 \u00a0 with that, i\u2019ll turn it over to heather.\u00a0 \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 thank you, cecilia.\u00a0 so the pandemic and the economic crisis have undermined the health and wellbeing of women and children in the united states.\u00a0 there are now 4.2 million fewer women working than there were in february of 2020, in large part because of the pandemic.\u00a0 millions more women have had to reduce their hours, often because taking care of the children is a responsibility that continues to fall disproportionately on women. \u00a0 our economic recovery depends on us addressing the barriers that have hampered women from fully participating in the labor force.\u00a0 \u00a0 so here\u2019s the good news: the american rescue plan will change the course of the pandemic and deliver immediate relief and support to women, families, and their communities critical to building a more equitable economy.\u00a0 \u00a0 the plan will increase the child tax credit from $2,000 per child to about $3,000 per child, and even more for a child under the age of six.\u00a0 this means a typical family of four with two young children will receive an additional $3,200 in assistance to cover the costs associated with raising children.\u00a0 this will benefit 66 million children.\u00a0 \u00a0 the plan will also increase the earned income tax credit for 17 million workers by as much as $1,000, benefiting many cashiers, food preparers and servers, and home health aides \u2014 those frontline workers who have helped their communities get through this crisis, many of them are women, many of whom are women of color.\u00a0 \u00a0 the plan also expands childcare assistance, helping hard- \u2014 hard-hit childcare providers, who are disproportionately women of color, cover their costs.\u00a0 and it will give families an additional tax credit to help them cut their childcare costs.\u00a0 families will get back, as a refundable tax credit, as much as half \u2014 half \u2014 of their spending on childcare for children under age 13.\u00a0 so they can receive a total of up to $4,000 for one child or up to $8,000 for two or more children.\u00a0 \u00a0 if we add it all up, these are historic actions that will not only help rescue our economy, they will help support our country\u2019s women and their families.\u00a0 but we know, as cecilia pointed out, we have to do more to close the wage gap and to take steps to ensure that all women, especially women of color, have their shot to get ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 and so, with that, we will take some questions.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 jennifer, kick us off. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 all right, thanks.\u00a0 a question for you both \u2014 this is on racial economic gaps.\u00a0 during the campaign, president biden talked about wanting the federal reserve to close income gaps and he wanted to measure the progress they make in closing those racial economic gaps.\u00a0 would you be willing to say if any steps have been taken so far towards requiring that sort of thing?\u00a0 is the white house still interested in talking to congress about amending the fed act to require some sort of measures? \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 sure, i\u2019m happy to take that.\u00a0 so, i can\u2019t speak to that exactly at this time.\u00a0 what i can say is that we are \u2014 this administration, across the administration \u2014 we are committed to addressing racial \u2014 the racial wage gaps and racial inequity gaps. \u00a0 i can say, at the cea, for example, we are using data to understand the impact of all of our policies when we study what\u2019s happening in the economy.\u00a0 we want to look at how it\u2019s not just affecting the average, but looking at all groups.\u00a0 \u00a0 and i would also mention that when chairman powell testified last \u2014 yesterday \u2014 i think it was just yesterday \u2014 and last week, he pointed to the fact that, as the federal reserve is doing its monetary policy, it is looking not just for the average unemployment rate to change; he is looking to see that the economy is doing well for everybody.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, you know, we are \u2014 we are very aligned on that. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks for doing this.\u00a0 josh boak with ap.\u00a0 lots of americans thought educational attainment would close the gender wage gap and racial inequality.\u00a0 but, in fact, if you look at college grads, the gap widens between men and women.\u00a0 some of that is due to age, but what are the factors driving here?\u00a0 why hasn\u2019t educational attainment delivered more? \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 i\u2019m happy to.\u00a0 yeah, so, you know, educational attainment was actually very instrumental in making some of the gains between my daughter \u2014 for, you know, the wage gap when i was coming up and my daughter. \u00a0 so we know that women getting hired \u2014 years of schooling was very important in the early years.\u00a0 but now we know that women, on average, are getting more schooling than men.\u00a0 so that is why it is not contributing as much.\u00a0 and what we see then is that there are other factors.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we see that the wage gap among young adults is actually fairly small.\u00a0 and it opens up particularly when women start families, which is why the care economy and the efforts we\u2019re making to ensure that workers \u2014 not just women, but all workers \u2014 can balance work and family is going to be so important.\u00a0 \u00a0 we also know that flexible workplaces is very important for helping workers to balance work/life \u2014 you know, the work responsibilities and job responsibilities.\u00a0 claudia goldin at harvard, for example, has found that the wage gap is smaller in occupations such as pharmacists where there\u2019s just more flexibility baked into the occupation.\u00a0 \u00a0 so there\u2019s still more work to be done.\u00a0 and i think it really goes to helping women in particular, but all workers balance responsibilities of family and work.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 karen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 heather, you had cited the statistics on 4.2 million fewer women now in the workforce than before covid.\u00a0 the president has said that women dropping out of the workforce during the pandemic is a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d\u00a0 are there new measures under discussion now, specifically on that issue, to reintroduce women back into the workforce \u2014 part of the build back better plan?\u00a0 and what can be done to bring them back in? \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 you know, i mean, the most important thing that we need to do is wrap our heads around this pandemic.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 \u00a0 so the steps that were taken as a part of the american rescue plan to, you know, deal with the health crisis, make sure that the vaccine gets out \u2014 all of those things \u2014 that is certainly going to be an important step forward so that schools can reopen safely. \u00a0 and then, of course, there are funds, as a part of the american rescue plan \u2014 historic investment in childcare centers to help them reopen safely.\u00a0 so part of what we see in this decline in women\u2019s employment is because of their \u2014 the fact that they\u2019re responsible for children; the fact that childcare centers have closed, schools aren\u2019t open, families are trying to telecommute, or they\u2019re trying to go out to their job and cope with children not having adequate care or the right care.\u00a0 that is really, i think, going to play an important role in getting folks back into the labor force. \u00a0 and i want to stress that\u2019s on both sides, right?\u00a0 in those caring economy parts of our economy, these are jobs that are disproportionately held by women.\u00a0 so, in making sure that schools are open and childcare centers are open, we\u2019re helping those women as workers and also as parents and caregivers.\u00a0 so i think that is \u2014 those are some of the first steps that we need to see.\u00a0 \u00a0 but, you know, over time, making sure that, as \u2014 you know, as cecilia said, making sure that we have that strong foundation in the care economy on issues around childcare, also issues around, you know, how we help families that have someone who needs some extra care or, sort of, later-in-life issues \u2014 the aging and the disabled \u2014 along with making sure that we have workplace flexibility and we have paid leave.\u00a0 these are all things that help make it possible for people who have care responsibilities to be full members of our economy and our society.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 andrea and weijia, and then we got to \u2014 we got to wrap it up.\u00a0 sorry.\u00a0 it\u2019s equal pay day.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just real quickly, in terms of the infrastructure package that\u2019s coming next \u2014 right? \u2014 so that we\u2019re talking about quite a lot of money: two to three trillion dollars.\u00a0 what specific things do you think essentially have to be part of that?\u00a0 and what role in all of this does the \u2014 sort of, your push for the federal minimum wage increase play?\u00a0 and how do you convince congress that that\u2019s an essential part?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 well, i can take a stab at that. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 do you want to \u2014 yeah.\u00a0 \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 so, you know, we know that the president has been so clear throughout the campaign and into governing on what his values are and where he wants to guide this economy.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 that we\u2019re focused on how we can deepen, strengthen, broaden the middle class.\u00a0 \u00a0 that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on equal pay day because we know that women are a key part of \u2014 you know, make up the workers that make up the middle class.\u00a0 and he\u2019s been very clear in his support of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\u00a0 that these are the kinds of focus that we need to have in \u2014 as the agenda is built out, this is what he\u2019s asked us to focus on.\u00a0 \u00a0 alongside this, we need to make sure that we are making sure that the economy is directed at enhancing, supporting, building american competitiveness so that we\u2019re creating those good jobs and they\u2019re available for all people \u2014 not just some people, but people all across these united states. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 yeah, i guess what i was just going to add to that is that \u2014 right? \u2014 this next package is really about investing in our future and in making the kinds of smart investments that we know will increase growth.\u00a0 and we want that growth to be widely shared.\u00a0 so the idea is not just to increase the size of the pie, but to ensure that everybody gets their slice, unlike many policies that had been followed in the past. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do you need to \u2014 i\u2019m sorry, do you need to like include some kind of private-sector initiatives to nudge those companies that aren\u2019t moving along as quickly? \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 look, i \u2014 we really can\u2019t speak to the specifics.\u00a0 i think you\u2019re used to jen saying she likes to keep her job.\u00a0 i\u2019d kind of like to keep mine, too.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 so we are \u2014 you know, we are looking at the most effective ways in order to meet these kinds of investments that we know are just so important to work on. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you so much.\u00a0 i think, just to follow up on karen\u2019s question: you know, making sure that there is support for the women is one thing, but will there be any concrete measures in the build back better plan to make sure the 4.2 million women have jobs to return to? \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 right.\u00a0 that is the exact purpose of the american rescue plan, right?\u00a0 the whole purpose is to get us through this pandemic with \u2014 and to help our businesses that are viable stay in business, to help the workers who need help paying their rent and getting food on the table to stay engaged and not just imagine that they\u2019re going to drop out and drop out forever.\u00a0 \u00a0 we know that the longer that we have the economic crisis and the longer that workers are out of the workforce, the harder it is for them to come back.\u00a0 so that is the entire focus of the american rescue plan \u2014 is to get us back on track so that by next year we are back to essentially full employment.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 thank you both so much for coming.\u00a0 \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 thank you. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 we\u2019d love to have you back. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 thank you. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay, i just have a couple of other items for you all at the top.\u00a0 \u00a0 as you know, this afternoon, the president and first lady will be joined by megan rapinoe and margaret purce at the white house for a virtual event with other members of the u.s. women\u2019s national team where the president will sign a proclamation marking equal pay day.\u00a0 \u00a0 additionally, the second gentleman is in st. louis, missouri, for a listening session on gender equity in the workforce. \u00a0 as cecilia and heather just detailed, the pandemic and economic crisis have undermined the health and wellbeing of women and children.\u00a0 the american rescue plan provides help for women and families by increasing the child tax credit, expanding childcare assistance, and providing women and families the relief they need.\u00a0 it also provides $130 billion to help schools serve all students and reopen. \u00a0 yesterday, on the anniversary of the affordable care act being signed into law, the president, of course, traveled to ohio \u2014 it was a great trip \u2014 where he announced that the administration would expand access to healthcare coverage by extending the special enrollment period until august 15th.\u00a0 i know a number of you noted that, but i just wanted to reiterate it since it was late in the day.\u00a0 \u00a0 this morning, the president was proud to sign into law the save lives act.\u00a0 the bipartisan piece of legislation will give the va the ability to provide vaccines to all veterans and boost vaccine efforts for veteran\u2019s families and caregivers.\u00a0 it\u2019s truly a testament to what government can do when we work together.\u00a0 he\u2019s grateful for the leadership of both the senate and house veterans\u2019 affairs committee: both chairs mark takano and jon tester, and ranking members mike bost and jerry moran. \u00a0 as we announced this morning \u2014 but to give you a little bit more detail \u2014 the president will travel to pittsburgh, pennsylvania, next week on wednesday, march 31st, where he will deliver a speech laying out more details of his plan to build the economy back better.\u00a0 \u00a0 over the next several days \u2014 and this is probably why they were hesitant to give more detail \u2014 he will continue meeting with his economic team to finalize details of his proposal, including the scale, scope, and final policy components.\u00a0 his focus, of course, will be on investing in america\u2019s workers, making sure the tax code rewards worth not wealth, delivering on the promises he made to the american people when he was running for president. \u00a0 with that, go ahead, josh. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 on the shooting in colorado, the president said, \u201ccongress must act.\u201d\u00a0 senator \u2014 senate majority leader schumer has also said the senate is poised to act.\u00a0 but vice president harris said today, on cbs, that she thought the change would have occurred after the sandy hook shootings.\u00a0 \u00a0 and i\u2019m curious: what does the president think is different this time?\u00a0 and how has he changed his approach so that this administration can pass these changes, when, in the past, it failed? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, first, the president shares that sentiment, as i think many americans do, that when we saw 20 children murdered, when we saw 6 adults murdered, that that would turn the tide of congress. \u00a0 we have seen data and statistics still \u2014 across the country \u2014 still broadly support background checks.\u00a0 i think it\u2019s about 80 percent of the american public support background checks, including a good percentage of gun owners support background checks.\u00a0 \u00a0 we\u2019ve seen states take action.\u00a0 since that time, a number of states across the country have put in place a number of laws.\u00a0 sometimes states are the leaders, as we know and we\u2019ve seen in other areas of policymaking.\u00a0 \u00a0 but i think the president, who has been in public life and public office for 50 years \u2014 more than 50 years \u2014 would be the first to tell you, if he were standing here, that just because you don\u2019t get the policymaking and the legislation done the first time, it doesn\u2019t mean you quit trying.\u00a0 \u00a0 and certainly, tragedies like we saw earlier this week, like we saw last week \u2014 mass shootings that are killing innocent lives, leaving family members without their loved ones \u2014 is a reminder of how important and vital that is.\u00a0 \u00a0 he has talked about, as he did yesterday, the importance of working with congress.\u00a0 i know the vice president touched on the fact that if we want something to be permanent, if we want it to be lasting, we need it to be legislation.\u00a0 he certainly believes that, but there are also executive actions under consideration that we will continue working through internally.\u00a0 and there\u2019s lots of levers you can take, obviously, as president and vice president. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, secondly, today is the first chance for many in the media to see the situation on the southern border at government facilities. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 this is the first step of transparency.\u00a0 what else can we expect with regard to that so we can evaluate the situation and present it to the public? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well first, as you noted \u2014 i know all of you have covered this, but just to kind of reiterate where we are here: so there\u2019s a delegation of members of congress and white house officials who are traveling to the office of refugee resettlement at carrizo springs in the \u2014 at the influx care facility there.\u00a0 there is a network pool camera that will be a part of this journey, which will be \u2014 which will ensure that there\u2019s network pool coverage \u2014 or network pool footage, i should say, that is provided to all of the networks so that you can all see, as the media, for yourselves and be able to provide analysis on that b-roll footage. \u00a0 and we are also \u2014 remain committed to transparency and will continue to work with agencies on creating avenues for media access to \u2014 and visibility into these facilities.\u00a0 \u00a0 so i think our balance is, of course, privacy; as you all know, it is also that we are in the middle of a pandemic; and that, you know, these facilities, of course, can\u2019t become forums for media access all day long every day.\u00a0 i think we all agree on that balance.\u00a0 but we will continue to look for ways to increase transparency and provide additional access and fulfill requests. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 a couple questions on guns and \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki: \u00a0sure. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 then aapi representation.\u00a0 and at what point would president biden consider taking executive action instead of waiting for congress to wait?\u00a0 in other words, how many measures would have to fail before he stepped in? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think he sees it as vital to take steps on two tracks because congressional legislation, as the vice president conveyed this morning, obviously has a more permanent, lasting impact.\u00a0 executive actions are, of course, an important lever that every president has at their disposal.\u00a0 \u00a0 there\u2019s current discussions and analysis internally of what steps can be taken \u2014 and that \u2014 that has been ongoing for several weeks, even before these two recent tragedies \u2014 that, you know, he looks forward to getting an update on and seeing what can be moved forward on that front as well. \u00a0 so he\u2019s not waiting for anything to fail is really the answer to your question. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what executive actions do you think he\u2019s most likely to take? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 i have it, myself, as well.\u00a0 but it\u2019s an ongoing policy process internally.\u00a0 i will say that his view, the vice president\u2019s view, and our policy team\u2019s view is that it\u2019s not just about addressing gun access.\u00a0 that\u2019s important and obviously there\u2019s legislation that\u2019s under consideration on background checks that they both strongly support, they want to see move forward.\u00a0 it\u2019s also about addressing community violence and, you know, a range of issues that are root causes and kind of lead to the \u2014 the deaths and the impact that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s so troubling.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 got it.\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 and then, on the other issue: you know, the white house had conversations with senators duckworth and hirono.\u00a0 i think one concern that they have brought is the question of who is advising president biden from the aapi community as we see this surge of violence.\u00a0 i know ambassador rice and cedric richmond are leading the engagement efforts.\u00a0 who in the aapi community is having direct conversations with the president about what\u2019s unfolding? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, you mentioned cedric and susan rice, who have been doing listening sessions for some time, and obviously those will continue to pick up.\u00a0 obviously, the vice president, who is the first in the meeting and the last in a meeting on every issue, including the impact of the violence and the threats and the \u2014 that we\u2019ve seen increase over the past several months against the aapi community \u2014 as a member herself of the aapi community, is certainly playing an important role on that.\u00a0 \u00a0 and as we noted in a statement we released last night, we are also adding a senior-level asian american/pacific islander liaison who will ensure the community\u2019s voice is further represented and heard \u2014 not just around crises, not just around an increase in violence, but in general, and, you know, playing an important role with a seat at the table. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and, to be clear, this is a new position in addition to the one over in public engagement?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 this is the one that we announced last night.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 so it\u2019s going to be a new senior-level position? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes, (inaudible).\u00a0 yep.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 will this this person also have a policy portfolio, or will it just be mainly outreach? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i can get you more specifics.\u00a0 i mean, i think that when they\u2019re \u2014 all the roles that are in our liaison \u2014 playing liaison roles typically have a seat at the table on a range of issues, so whether it is healthcare or climate or community violence.\u00a0 so, typically, it\u2019s having a seat at the table on a range of topics, but i can see if there\u2019s more specifics.\u00a0 obviously, we have not hired yet because we just announced this last night. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to follow up on the discussion: the president \u2014 you were talking yesterday about executive action on gun reform.\u00a0 the president also was making it clear he wanted to see congress act. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 he said that several times. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 would he propose his own gun reform plan that he would present to congress, as we\u2019ve seen them do with the covid relief plan and what we anticipate coming on the economic plan?\u00a0 would this be something that could originate here and not wait for congress to move? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 you know, karen, i think it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 there\u2019s obviously a lot of pieces of legislation that have been proposed.\u00a0 there\u2019s these two background check bills that are \u2014 have moved their way through the house.\u00a0 there\u2019s also legislation that\u2019s been proposed by senator feinstein, congressman cicilline that addresses some banning \u2014 an assault weapons ban, which is something the president worked to pass in the \u201890s when he was in the senate.\u00a0 \u00a0 so there\u2019s a range of steps that can be taken to increase gun safety measures.\u00a0 what our team is looking at now is: what is the legislation that\u2019s out there?\u00a0 are there any gaps that need to be filled; policies or proposals that have been introduced in the past that could be reintroduced?\u00a0 \u00a0 so i don\u2019t have anything to predict for you on whether there\u2019d be something independent.\u00a0 i think we\u2019re looking at what a number of passionate gun safety advocates on the hill have already introduced to see where we can help push the boulder on that.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 has the president spoken with any of the families of the colorado shooting \u2014 any of the victims\u2019 families?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any calls to read out for you.\u00a0 you know, he is somebody who obviously has a deep connection to loss, and we don\u2019t always read out those calls.\u00a0 i can check and see if there\u2019s anything that has \u2014 that he has done that he\u2019d be comfortable conveying to all of you.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and can i just do one more on the border? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 could you give us an update on progress from the family reunification task force?\u00a0 have there been families, children reunited back with their parents?\u00a0 where does that stand right now? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 there have been.\u00a0 and a lot of that has happened through lawyers and outside groups and the ngo community that plays an incredible role here.\u00a0 \u00a0 there will be an update provided at day 120 that will be more of an official report and update out of the department of homeland security.\u00a0 so, in advance of that, i\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll have incremental updates, but there have been some progress made, thanks in large part to the work of legal experts and ngos on the outside. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and the task force is working with those ngos? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 they\u2019re in touch with them as well, but we\u2019ll have our first formal update at day 120 and then, i believe, every 60 days thereafter. \u00a0 go ahead, jeff. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jen, why did the president wait until there was another shooting until he addressed gun violence in america?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 he actually addressed it.\u00a0 we put out a statement in his name on the anniversary of \u2014 in early february, the anniversary of the shooting in florida.\u00a0 so he has addressed it before and certainly has stressed it even as president and will continue to address it as president.\u00a0 \u00a0 and as you know, geoff, from covering him in congress for a long time, this has been a passion of his \u2014 putting in place gun safety measures \u2014 throughout his career.\u00a0 that\u2019s why he fought to get the brady bill passed, why he fought to ban assault weapons, why he was the lead in the obama-biden administration in putting in place more than a dozen executive actions to make it safer for our communities.\u00a0 and it\u2019s something that he will continue to work on as president. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of course, he knows, though, that the president\u2019s bully pulpit is unparalleled, and yet it took him until more than 60 days into his presidency to talk about gun violence, on camera, in america.\u00a0 what does that say about his commitment or how much political capital he\u2019s willing to spend on this issue?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i first would say that anybody who has been following the tragedies and the shootings that have happened in our country over the past several years, if not decades, knows that this is an issue the president is deeply committed to, and his career is evidence of that.\u00a0 \u00a0 and i don\u2019t think anyone who\u2019s an advocate is looking at how many words he\u2019s spoken; they\u2019re looking at what his background has been, where he has fought the fights.\u00a0 and he has fought the fights on the brady bill, on the assault weapons ban, on getting legislation passed.\u00a0 it wasn\u2019t successful, as was alluded to earlier in a question.\u00a0 we know that.\u00a0 but this is something he\u2019s going to put his shoulder into; he\u2019s going to work with members of both parties; he\u2019s going to certainly advocate for it. \u00a0 and i think for those who have survived gun violence, for those who\u2019ve lost family members, they\u2019re really looking for action, and they\u2019re really looking at the record that he has or \u2014 he has over the course of the decades of his career. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if i could follow up on the question on the border: the access being granted today for the pool is of a facility that is aspirational of where you want to move these children.\u00a0 what about access to the facilities where there is overcrowding and there is an actual problem?\u00a0 why was this one chosen over those? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 we\u2019re also open to providing access there, and this is just the first step in the process of providing greater access to the media. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and when would that decision to be made?\u00a0 you said earlier this week that you would be working on access.\u00a0 is this the only access, or will that be coming in the coming days like the \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no, i would \u2014 i would consider it \u2014 it\u2019s ongoing, and we wanted to provide pool coverage, as you all know who are in the television \u2014 field of television that allows for video \u2014 a video camera to provide access to all the networks.\u00a0 we felt that would be a good first step, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to engage about how to provide increased access. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 would you agree, though, that you\u2019ve chosen the facility that is the aspirational facility, as opposed to the problem at this moment?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i would say we all agree that the border patrol facilities are not places where children should be.\u00a0 they are \u2014 children should be moving more quickly through those facilities.\u00a0 that is what our policy\u2019s central focus is right now, as you know, jeff.\u00a0 and there are also \u2014 it\u2019s also becoming a public health concern because of the number of kids who are moving through those facilities and the fact \u2014 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but why not show those?\u00a0 why not show those to the american people? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, we will, and we are working with the border patrol and with dhs to determine how we can do that.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead, jennifer. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on iraq and withdrawing u.s. troops from iraq, could you please give us an update on iraq\u2019s request for the start of talks on that withdrawal, please? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 that\u2019s something we are looking forward to convening next month.\u00a0 and i\u2019m not sure if i have an update, other than to convey that we look forward to our strategic dialogue with the government of iraq over the month of april.\u00a0 the meetings will further clarify that coalition forces are in iraq at the invitation of the iraqi government and solely for the purpose of training and advising iraqi forces to ensure that isis cannot reconstitute.\u00a0 \u00a0 and we are committed, first and foremost, to iraq sovereignty.\u00a0 we look forward to these important discussions with iraqi leaders on the future of our partnership that will convene next month. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i got a couple of quick ones for you.\u00a0 so, on nord stream 2 \u2014 that is an issue that keeps coming up in the relationship with germany \u2014 how soon do you think those sanctions will be implemented?\u00a0 and has the president had a chance to discuss this issue, at his level, with the chancellor of germany? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any calls, although we do read out the calls that he does.\u00a0 so you would certainly know if he had a call with the chancellor of germany, i can assure you.\u00a0 so not a new one that i\u2019m aware of that you are not aware of.\u00a0 \u00a0 we continue to believe it\u2019s a bad deal.\u00a0 i don\u2019t think we have an update on the po- \u2014 our policy position beyond that.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and then, 14 states have now sued the administration over the oil and gas \u2014 over the pause in oil and gas leasing.\u00a0 what do you say to that?\u00a0 and how do you move beyond that?\u00a0 i mean, how do you \u2014 how do you \u2014 you know, i realize there\u2019s a legal process, but how do you address \u2014 how you get your point across in this legal environment? \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 well, i would say, first, oil and gas jobs aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u00a0 the outgoing administration flooded the oil markets with cheap federal leases.\u00a0 this will not affect oil and gas production or jobs for years to come.\u00a0 \u00a0 and what president biden has pledged to do is invest to create jobs and ensure america leads the clean energy revolution, which is where the industry is largely going anyway, where there is the greatest opportunity for job creation.\u00a0 he wants to create good-paying union jobs.\u00a0 and that\u2019s something he believes and he\u2019s committed to doing.\u00a0 \u00a0 i think there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 there is some misinformation out there about what this means, which is why it\u2019s \u2014 not \u2014 and i\u2019m not saying from the media; i\u2019m just saying in general.\u00a0 and again, there are oil and gas jobs that are out there.\u00a0 the existing leases will continue.\u00a0 he\u2019s really talking about future leases. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and then just one more on the gun issue.\u00a0 i know this is kind of a crazy question, but \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s always a good lead-in when it\u2019s a crazy question.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 it\u2019s quite a lead-in. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 you know, given the history of people trying to enact gun control legislation in this country \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 is there some consideration to taking a look at the second amendment and just addressing it from a, sort of, this \u2014 the underlying constitutional right to bear arms?\u00a0 does that \u2014 is that something that the president feels needs to be called into question so many years after the revolution? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no one is talking about overturning or changing the second amendment.\u00a0 what our focus is on is putting in place commonsense measures that will make our communities safer, make families safer, make kids safer.\u00a0 the majority of the american public supports background checks.\u00a0 the majority of the american public does not believe that anyone needs to have an assault weapon.\u00a0 so that\u2019s really what our focus is on at this point in time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and, jen \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 oh. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 joe manchin is not in support of this.\u00a0 once again, you have a democrat, a member of the president\u2019s own party, who is already signaling that he will not support that.\u00a0 you have a very slim majority.\u00a0 can you convince republicans to support this legislation so that you can work around a democrat that\u2019s not supporting it? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 as the president said yesterday, we don\u2019t know yet; he hasn\u2019t done the vote count.\u00a0 \u00a0 but it is certainly an issue he will talk to members about and convey why he feels it\u2019s so important; that it\u2019s not a \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be a political issue; that keeping our community safe, family safe, looking at the track record as what has worked in states \u2014 which is very informative, and actually, to josh\u2019s earlier question, something that we know more about now than we may have 10 years ago.\u00a0 so he will be conveying that to members he\u2019s communicating with. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 two questions.\u00a0 following up on weijia\u2019s question about representation: the biden administration is the first in 20 years to not have an asian american lead one of the 15 executive departments in the cabinet.\u00a0 so how does the white house square that fact with the president\u2019s pledges to make this the most representative, most diverse in history? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i will just say the president remains committed to making sure this is the most diverse administration in history.\u00a0 that has always been \u2014 remains our goal.\u00a0 we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.\u00a0 we have the most diverse cabinet in history.\u00a0 we will continue to make progress.\u00a0 we have aapi staff at senior levels and at all levels of the administration, and we will continue to work to find ways to elevate aapi voices at the highest level of government.\u00a0 \u00a0 there are a number of cabinet level \u2014 i know it\u2019s not 15 members, so \u2014 but just to note, obviously, katherine tai, who received overwhelming support in the senate in her approval to be confirmed for ustr; julie su at the department of labor; kiran ahuja \u2014 i\u2019m going to butcher that name, and i apologize to kiran \u2014 at opm; todd kim, the assistant attorney general at doj.\u00a0 so we will continue \u2014 and obviously there are more positions and roles that we need to fill. \u00a0 and i will say, first and foremost, the president\u2019s view is that we need to listen, and that is an important component of how we\u2019re communicating with members of congress as concerns arise.\u00a0 also with leaders in the community, as he and the vice president did last friday \u2014 why it\u2019s so important, as we look to policymaking, to have senior members of our administration do listening sessions in the community to determine how we can best address needs.\u00a0 \u00a0 is it \u2014 there\u2019s personnel, of course, and we will continue to work toward that.\u00a0 there\u2019s policies.\u00a0 and that\u2019s part of our objective and our focus at this point in time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and also, a quick one on guns.\u00a0 the president also talked several times about a federal assault weapons ban, and i\u2019m wondering how he plans to build a coalition around that when \u2014 even when that policy is something that is opposed by many moderate democrats in congress. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, though, it is supported by the majority of the american people, and that is an important fact.\u00a0 and he will \u2014 it\u2019s something that he has long had a view and a belief: that no one needs an assault weapon, that it is not something that should be a part of what people have access to in this country.\u00a0 and he will continue to \u2014 \u00a0 so are you asking, kind of, who will he talk to?\u00a0 or who will he \u2014 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how does he plan to build the coalition in congress to build that support? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, part of it is certainly communicating with the advocates; it\u2019s communicating with outside groups, with gun owners, many of whom will tell you that they don\u2019t believe they would support an assault weapons ban; communicating with leaders in states where laws have been put in place that have been impactful; and, obviously, having conversations with members he\u2019s known for some time \u2014 having them at the staff level and determining if we can find a path forward. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 i\u2019d like to ask you two questions \u2014\u00a0the first about marijuana and the second about a bit of a historical mystery i\u2019m hoping you could help us solve. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 there\u2019s a lot of setups for these questions today.\u00a0 i like it.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 so vice president kamala harris says that she is a past marijuana smoker.\u00a0 she said, quote, \u201cit gives\u2026people joy.\u00a0 and we need more joy in this world.\u201d\u00a0 she is with a clear majority of the u.s. population in supporting marijuana legalization.\u00a0 according to polls, two thirds of people do, including about half of republicans.\u00a0 \u00a0 yet, last week, the daily beast reported that there were dozens of white house staffers who were either disciplined or terminated from their jobs for past marijuana use.\u00a0 you seem to confirm five terminations on twitter.\u00a0 \u00a0 and my question is: why would president biden allow this to happen, especially considering the white house staff were led to believe that pot use would not be disqualifying, especially considering the vice president is herself a former marijuana user? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, let me first say that what we tried to do as an administration was work with the security service who actually makes these determinations about suitability for serving in government.\u00a0 in the past \u2014 and i served in the obama-biden administration \u2014 the rules were actually far more stringent.\u00a0 so that isn\u2019t about anyone\u2019s personal point of view; it\u2019s about working through the process, the history, and modernizing it and taking steps to address the fact that marijuana is legal in a number of states across the country.\u00a0 it is still illegal federally.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 we know that.\u00a0 \u00a0 there were \u2014 as i noted, i think, in our comment last week \u2014 five individuals who are no longer employed at the white house.\u00a0 a number of them \u2014 there were other security issues that were raised, and, you know, that\u2019s an unfortunate conclusion, of course.\u00a0 \u00a0 but what we try to do is enable additional members of the team, who would not have been able to continue serving in past administrations, to continue serving by updating our policy in coordination with the security service.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just to follow up on that, surely president biden could, you know, implement changes here unilaterally and just say that these people can come to work for him.\u00a0 why \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i think if marijuana was federally legal, that might be a different circumstance.\u00a0 but i don\u2019t \u2014 i don\u2019t think i have any more for this on you \u2014 on this for you. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do you have any more data on the number of people impacted other than the five people who were terminated? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any more data for you, other than to convey that there were a number of people who would not have been able to serve in past administrations.\u00a0 and because of our efforts to modernize and work with the security service, they\u2019re able to serve. \u00a0 did you have another question? \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 yes, i do. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so this is a, as i set it up, a bit of a mystery.\u00a0 and i\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve inquired about this yourself and \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 oh, okay.\u00a0 where\u2019s the cat?\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no, no, it\u2019s not that. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so there was a report last year from the senate finance and homeland security committees.\u00a0 it claimed that the wife of moscow\u2019s former mayor paid a company associated with the president\u2019s son $3.5 million.\u00a0 there was no explanation for this alleged payments, and i\u2019m wondering if you could tell us if that claim is accurate, and if so, what the $3.5 million was paid for. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m not familiar with that claim.\u00a0 it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s backed up by a lot of evidence.\u00a0 if you have evidence or specifics, i\u2019m happy to discuss it further. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (inaudible) the senate committee\u2019s report.\u00a0 so you haven\u2019t asked about this?\u00a0 or \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m not familiar with the report at all.\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 with the may 1st deadline looming, when can we expect to hear from the president about the timing on withdrawal from afghanistan? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s a good question.\u00a0 as you may know, secretary blinken is currently in brussels and talking with our nato european partners.\u00a0 he did a press avail \u2014 i believe it was yesterday.\u00a0 \u00a0 but let me reiterate a couple of the points he made, and then i\u2019ll get to your question: that our focus right now is to \u2014 is, for him, to share some of our thinking with our vital nato partners, consult with them, hear from them on where they see things going, where they want things to go; that, as the president had said last week, it\u2019s tough meeting that may 1st timeline, and the secretary of state reiterated that in his remarks as well.\u00a0 \u00a0 whatever we do will be informed by our allies and partners.\u00a0 but the president is currently discussing, of course, with policy team members on what is possible.\u00a0 and hopefully he\u2019ll have an update soon, but i don\u2019t have a timeline on that for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do you expect any announcement this week? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i can\u2019t give you a timeline.\u00a0 it\u2019s really up to his own decision making and when he\u2019s prepared to talk about that publicly.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 i have a couple of foreign policy questions.\u00a0 i understand the administration has already supported covax, is working with the quad to ramp up production, working out details with mexico and canada.\u00a0 but where is the president\u2019s position on the request by more than 55 countries, as well as some democratic lawmakers, on making vaccine patent through the who \u2014 giving a waiver to that? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, the top priority of the president\u2019s and of the united states is saving lives and ending the pandemic in the united states and, of course, around the world.\u00a0 that includes investing in covax; working with partners, as we announced with the quad, to produce a billion vaccine doses to surge vaccine production and delivery.\u00a0 as part of rebuilding our alliances, we\u2019re exploring every avenue to coordinate with our global partners and are evaluating the efficacy of any measure by its true potential to save lives.\u00a0 \u00a0 so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it through the prism.\u00a0 there are probably \u2014 there are a number of steps, a number of ways we are engaged in addressing the global pandemic through the global international community, and we\u2019ll look at a range of options.\u00a0 but i don\u2019t have any update for you on the patent question. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but just as a general principle, do you believe that protecting american innovation and intellectual property of pharmaceutical companies outweighs the benefit of moving faster towards a covid-free world? \u00a0 ms. psaki: \u00a0sure \u2014 i absolutely understand your question. what i\u2019m conveying is we look at every option through the prism of whether it will save lives and how many lives it will save, and try to put our resources and efforts into those that we think will be most effective.\u00a0 \u00a0 you know, obviously, part of that is through engagement with the who.\u00a0 i mentioned our quad partnership, our meaningful contribution to covax.\u00a0 and, of course, when we can, we will share vaccines \u2014 as we have already, as we are already doing with canada and mexico.\u00a0 but we\u2019re looking at a range of options.\u00a0 \u00a0 right now, our focus is on continuing to address the pandemic that is ongoing in the united states, given a thousand people are still dying every single day. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 another foreign policy question, please.\u00a0 so can you comment on media reports on whether the administration is considering joining a group of south american nations to push back against chinese illegal fishing?\u00a0 how big of a problem does the administration see this kind of chinese practice of distant-water fishing?\u00a0 and would this be something that you would consider with other regions, including southeast asia and africa? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 it is a challenge and a problem, and one that we\u2019re watching closely.\u00a0 and for others who have not been following this issue as closely, it is an issue of overfishing in certain parts of the world.\u00a0 it is something our national security team is certainly watching and following closely.\u00a0 i can see if there\u2019s more specifics on their engagements to update you on. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and one domestic question.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just a question on vaccination for federal government employees.\u00a0\u00a0 i mean, so far, it\u2019s been pretty much where they live, right?\u00a0 i mean, if you\u2019re in d.c., you follow d.c. rules \u2014 maryland, and so forth.\u00a0 is there any other kind of consideration from the white house to just expand access to vaccines for federal government employees? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 i\u2019ll have to check with our covid team.\u00a0 obviously, everyone will be eligible in just over a month, including our government employees.\u00a0 and d.c. and virginia have already made that commitment \u2014 maybe maryland, too.\u00a0 i don\u2019t want to leave them out.\u00a0 so that is good news for every federal government employee.\u00a0 but i can check and see if there\u2019s more specifics across the administration about our approach. \u00a0 go ahead, in the back.\u00a0 and then, we\u2019ll go back. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of questions.\u00a0 first, i wanted to ask about voting rights.\u00a0 the senate right now is debating its own version of the for the people act. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it\u2019s \u2014 there are a few hang-ups with it in the chamber.\u00a0 i was curious how much emphasis the president plans to put on this \u2014 if he will be reaching out directly, or if there\u2019s a team from the white house that\u2019s working on this issue. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes, i would say we\u2019re very engaged \u2014 closely engaged on s1 that is being negotiated, as you said.\u00a0 and there are changes being made \u2014 which we fully expected that there would be, as a number of senators, i believe, have alluded to that being a possibility and things they\u2019d like to see changed. so it\u2019s working its way through the process.\u00a0 we get regular updates \u2014 our legislative team does.\u00a0 and we remain very closely engaged. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and i wanted to ask: leader mcconnell has said that he hasn\u2019t been invited to the white house and he hasn\u2019t had a direct conversation with the president since the inauguration. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think he corrected that statement. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 i was curious because i know, previously, leader mccarthy had said that he had tried to reach out to the white house to get an invitation here.\u00a0 does the president plan to have some sort of big, you know, meeting with leaders from across the aisle where we would see photos of them together and things like that? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m sure he will.\u00a0 we obviously have been limited on covid to any events in the east wing.\u00a0 and at this point, we\u2019d be very much in the east- \u2014 the easter egg roll preparations, which, of course, we will not be \u2014 but obviously more important, substantive, vital meetings than that.\u00a0 \u00a0 he\u2019s had a number of meetings \u2014 bipartisan meetings in the oval office.\u00a0 he will continue to do those.\u00a0 those have often been constructed with committee chairs or members with specific jurisdiction.\u00a0 he has \u2014 he has a long friendship with leader mcconnell.\u00a0 he has spoken with him.\u00a0 he speaks with him regularly.\u00a0 we\u2019re obviously not going to read out all of those calls.\u00a0 and i expect that will continue. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and i wanted to ask: we\u2019ve been seeing a lot of images of spring breakers, especially in florida, and i was curious how aware of that the president \u2014 if he is being updated on that regularly and if he plans to make any sort of address or public appeal to people on the issue. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, we do watch that closely.\u00a0 the president is briefed regularly by his covid team, and, of course, he has seen the news coverage \u2014 thanks to all of you \u2014 of spring breakers who have been gathering in far too many numbers.\u00a0 there, of course, were steps taken locally in response to this.\u00a0 we also watch that closely.\u00a0 \u00a0 you know, i\u2019m not sure i\u2019d \u2014 i don\u2019t have anything to preview for you in terms of him addressing spring breakers publicly.\u00a0 \u00a0 i will say that his message, broadly speaking, is that we are still at war with the virus.\u00a0 this is still a threat to the lives of the american people.\u00a0 we need to be vigilant.\u00a0 we need to wear masks.\u00a0 we need to hand wash.\u00a0 and that is a message, of course, directly to anybody who is not abiding by the recommendations of public health officials. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and if i could just \u2014 one more.\u00a0 do you have any update on the president\u2019s plans?\u00a0 will he be traveling to boulder? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any updates on that.\u00a0 as you all know, this tragedy only happened just about 36 hours ago.\u00a0 and obviously that would be done in consultation with local officials, who i\u2019m \u2014 who i know are still digesting the events and \u2014 in their community, working on healing in their community. \u00a0 i can note, since you reminded me, he did speak with the mayor this morning, as well, and he had spoken with the governor yesterday, and will remain in close touch. \u00a0 let me just go to the back, and then we\u2019ll come back.\u00a0 go ahead, in the back, lalit. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 last week, secretary blinken and nsa jake sullivan had a meeting in anchorage with chinese counterparts.\u00a0 have they \u2014 have they given the briefing to the president on the china policy?\u00a0 had \u2014 has it changed any chinese policy on the biden administration? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 all the \u2014 i know that the president has spoken with secretary blinken and national security advisor jake sullivan since their return.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any \u2014 obviously, they talked about a range of national security issues, ongoing policy processes that are ongoing.\u00a0 \u00a0 we\u2019re currently taking stock of where we are, which includes close consultation with allies and partners \u2014 as i noted, secretary of state is in brussels currently \u2014 on the way forward, and we\u2019ll continue to work with china going forward when it\u2019s in the interest of the american people.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we\u2019re in \u2014 consulting internally, consulting with our partners and allies, and that\u2019s really the stage we\u2019re in at this time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i have a question related to legal immigration.\u00a0 when vice president was a senator, she supported the cause of ead \u2014 employment authorization cards \u2014 for h4 and l2 visa holders.\u00a0 now these guys are saying \u2014 well, most of them are women, basically.\u00a0 they\u2019re saying there is a very long delay in issuing ead cards for h4 and l2 visa holders.\u00a0 some of them have also went to the court.\u00a0 what is your \u2014 why these delays there? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think part of the reason we want to push for action on immigration on the hill is to move forward with expediting the processing and doing that on several levels, including a number of the visas that you just \u2014 just introduced or just conveyed.\u00a0 so that\u2019s part of the reason why we think that\u2019s such an important piece to move forward on. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a final one: a number of indian american doctors whose job is to treat patients during this covid \u2014 covid era, they are on the hill protesting against and demanding elimination of country quota for green cards.\u00a0 i know the white house has sent a legislation to the hill and \u2014 that talks about that.\u00a0 but they\u2019re still protesting against \u2014 and faster implementation of that passage of that bill.\u00a0 what is president\u2019s message to those doctors? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think the president is \u2014 would reiterate that he believes that there should be faster processing, that our immigration system is broken at many levels, and \u2014 of the system, and that he is eager to \u2014 for congress to move forward with action there. \u00a0 okay, two in back.\u00a0 go ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 on \u2014 back on guns, you mentioned bipartisan meetings.\u00a0 i\u2019m wondering if you give a little bit more of a sense of the president\u2019s engagement with congress on gun legislation specifically.\u00a0 does he plan to have a bipartisan meeting on that at the white house?\u00a0 and has he spoken to senator manchin at all about his opposition to that background check bill? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any meetings to predict.\u00a0 obviously, you know, this is an issue that is \u2014 there are a number of passionate gun safety advocates on the hill, as you well know, who have strong views about what the path forward should look like. \u00a0so i have no doubt that he has discussed this issue with them over the course of the last two months of his presidency.\u00a0 \u00a0 as it relates to the tragedy of tuesday night, he was, of course in ohio all day yesterday with a very full schedule.\u00a0 so i don\u2019t \u2014 he didn\u2019t have any calls yesterday.\u00a0 but, you know, it\u2019s something that he will continue to look for ways to engage, to discuss, to advocate for action moving forward.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and is there an update on his joint session to congress? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no update yet.\u00a0 we have a speech coming up next week.\u00a0 and we \u2014 certainly, he remains interested in and committed to doing a joint session.\u00a0 we remain engaged with them, but i don\u2019t have an update on the specific timing.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and if i can just ask one more from one of the reporters in the pool who couldn\u2019t be here. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there was an axios report today that he met with historians to discuss how aggressive he could be on his economic agenda, among other topics.\u00a0 i\u2019m wondering if you can confirm the meeting, and maybe tell us who was involved and why he felt the need to meet with historians on this. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i will tell you: presidents love historians.\u00a0 i know this from \u2014 this is my second president working for.\u00a0 and, you know, i think it\u2019s important to learn from what worked and didn\u2019t work in the past and gain perspective from people who study that.\u00a0 \u00a0 so he did meet with historians a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have the list of names in front of me.\u00a0 i can see if there\u2019s more details we can provide.\u00a0 and really, it\u2019s meant to have an open conversation about the challenges we\u2019re country \u2014 our country is facing and looking back at history.\u00a0 and it\u2019s a moment to step back and reflect and use it as lessons moving forward.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 a few on spending and one on taxes as well.\u00a0 i know you can\u2019t get into specifics at this point, but what the president is being briefed on by his economic team in the upcoming days, is this an infrastructure package?\u00a0 is it the president\u2019s build back better plan?\u00a0 a combination of both?\u00a0 give us an overview of what it is. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, our build back better agenda \u2014 his build back better agenda includes a number of components that he talked about on the campaign trail.\u00a0 infrastructure is part of it.\u00a0 making the tax code fair and one that rewards work, and not wealth, is part of it.\u00a0 doing better by our caregivers is part of that.\u00a0 increasing access to healthcare is part of it.\u00a0 investing in our clean energy economy is part of it.\u00a0 \u00a0 there are several components he talked about on the campaign trail. \u00a0and right now, what he\u2019s talking with his economic team and advisors about are \u2014 is what the scale, the scope, and the components will look like in what he\u2019s going to move forward and propose next week. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the $3 trillion number has been put out there.\u00a0 i know the white house hasn\u2019t confirmed that, but is it possible that it goes above $3 trillion?\u00a0 like, is $3 trillion viewed as the cap, or it\u2019s certainly possible it could go even higher? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, again, i think what we\u2019re looking at is all of those components, as i just laid out, all of which may not \u2014 will not be in a speech next week.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 this is a big \u2014 big components of his agenda that he talked about on the campaign trail.\u00a0 \u00a0 so \u2014 and right now, he\u2019s having a conversation about the scale and the scope of what proposals look like.\u00a0 there\u2019s lots of ways to frame it, to shape it, to size it, so i don\u2019t have any more to predict for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 last one on this, before taxes.\u00a0 speaking of size and scope, it\u2019s possible, if it gets broken up, that infrastructure could be won.\u00a0 so what does the president, what does the white house view as infrastructure?\u00a0 what falls under that umbrella? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 under infrastructure?\u00a0 there\u2019s a lot of ways to look at infrastructure.\u00a0 i can\u2019t preview for you \u2014 i know you\u2019re not exactly asking this \u2014 what will be in the package that he\u2019s still discussing.\u00a0 but obviously, roads, rails, and bridges are part of what everybody historically thinks about.\u00a0 but there\u2019s also components like our cyber infrastructure. \u00a0there\u2019s lots of ways to look at infrastructure.\u00a0 but how \u2014 what is in a package that he proposes in the coming months, i don\u2019t have anything more to detail for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, on taxes: the white house says now that families who make up to $400,000 won\u2019t pay a penny more under the president\u2019s potential plan \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 mm-hmm. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 to the federal government in taxes.\u00a0 so \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 which is 98 percent of families.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so what about individuals?\u00a0 if you\u2019re an individual and you make up to \u201cblank,\u201d you won\u2019t pay more to uncle sam.\u00a0 what is that number? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 $400,000. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so the individual number is going to be same as the joint filer number? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, the \u2014 no more \u2014 nobody \u2014 no individual making less than a hundred \u2014 four hundred thousand dollars will pay more in taxes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so if you\u2019re an individual and you make $300,000, let\u2019s just say, and you \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 that\u2019s less than 400, right?\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and you\u2019re a married couple that makes 300 and 150, that\u2019s more than 450.\u00a0 the 300 isn\u2019t going to \u2014 traditionally, taxes \u2014 the joint filers pay about \u2014 it\u2019s doubled.\u00a0 but you\u2019re saying now it will be the same rate? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think we\u2019ll have more to say when we actually roll out a tax proposal, which we have not done yet.\u00a0 so this is a commitment he made on the campaign trail, which he has committed to abiding by.\u00a0 but once we propose a tax proposal, we\u2019ll have more to discuss on it.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so just to be clear: individual filers, if you make up to $400,000 \u2014 you\u2019re an individual \u2014 you will not pay a penny more, just like families won\u2019t pay a penny more? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 that\u2019s right.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jen, quick one \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 as the pooler, from a tv colleague who can\u2019t be here today. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 can you give us an update on major and champ, and whether they are at the white house? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 oh, i was waiting for this to come up.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we can end it on this one.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 of course.\u00a0 (laughs.)\u00a0 champ and major are here at the white house.\u00a0 they joined the first family at camp david last weekend and returned with them on sunday.\u00a0 the dogs will come and go, and it will not be uncommon for them to head back to delaware on occasion, as the president and first lady often do as well. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 is it about the dogs?\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on colin kahl \u2014 he\u2019s one of the president\u2019s nominees \u2014 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 for a top pentagon post.\u00a0 he barely just made it out of committee right now.\u00a0 can you say \u2014 is the white house still behind his nomination?\u00a0 it\u2019s been controversial from the beginning.\u00a0 any thoughts on that? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 absolutely.\u00a0 colin is qualified.\u00a0 he\u2019s experienced.\u00a0 and he would bring an incredible reservoir of perspective to the job at the department of defense.\u00a0 so we look forward to his confirmation. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so no consideration whatsoever of withdrawing his nomination? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 nope. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if i could close the loop on, kind of, the leader mcconnell question.\u00a0 you said they speak regularly.\u00a0 he says that they\u2019ve only spoken one time.\u00a0 he corrected his statement saying they spoke one time on burma.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 mm-hmm. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 have they spoken beyond that

have more to read out for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 has the president\u2019s definition of bipartisanship change since he arrived in office on january 20th?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no.\u00a0 his definition of bipartisanship has always been working on behalf of the american people and governing for all people \u2014 whether it\u2019s democrats, republicans, independents \u2014 and moving forward on proposals and policies that will make their lives better. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 with or without republican votes? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, he doesn\u2019t believe that bipartisanship is defined by the zip code here.\u00a0 he believes it\u2019s on how we can deliver relief to the american people. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay, thanks, everyone. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on omb, do you have any timing on when you might announce a replacement for neera tanden?\u00a0 now that \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i do not.\u00a0 but shalanda young is confirmed; she will be the acting.\u00a0 and so \u2014 but i don\u2019t have a personnel preview for you on that particular role. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jen, can i have one more question on china vaccine diplomacy?\u00a0 is the administration doing anything specific to push back against requirements by china for countries to cut back or reduce ties to taiwan?\u00a0 is the \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i will check with our national security team if there\u2019s anything for that on your \u2014 on that for you.\u00a0 \u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 \u00a0 1:32 p.m. edt"},

president:\u00a0 well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 megan and margaret, thank you.\u00a0 thank you for being here.\u00a0 and to all your teammates virtually, thank you as well.\u00a0 i\u2019m an unadulterated fan.\u00a0 not a joke.\u00a0 not a joke.\u00a0 \u00a0 and both of you and your entire team \u2014 i\u2019m not joking \u2014 have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters, who, i might add, are all really good athletes: one two-time all-state; my niece, all-american.\u00a0 there\u2019s a whole lot of talent in the biden family athletics, almost all on the women\u2019s side of the equation.\u00a0 but i \u2014 really, thank you for what you\u2019ve done. \u00a0 you know, you\u2019re all heroes for so many people \u2014 and that\u2019s not hyperbole to suggest that \u2014 on and off the field.\u00a0 you know, and it matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years.\u00a0 \u00a0 megan, it\u2019s hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign.\u00a0 i said it last april, when we spoke, and i\u2019ll say it again: the fact that jill and i get to talk with you and your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters.\u00a0 not a joke.\u00a0 i went so far as i took \u2014 they might may say \u2014 a privilege of getting our granddaughter maisy, who is a rising junior at the university of pennsylvania \u2014 up taking a course right now \u2014 i got her on the phone so she \u2014 all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them virtually.\u00a0 and she\u2019s a soccer player.\u00a0 \u00a0 and as jill mentioned, seeing you win the world cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country.\u00a0 and i didn\u2019t bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 no, i\u2019m serious \u2014 and off the field.\u00a0 you all made me a hero with my granddaughters.\u00a0 \u00a0 and the reason we\u2019re here today is because it\u2019s equal pay day, which has been around for 25 years.\u00a0 it was declared 25 years ago \u2014 equal pay day \u2014 though not enough people know about that and \u2014 and they \u2014 as they should. \u00a0 you know, it\u2019s a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year.\u00a0 that\u2019s what jill was talking about.\u00a0 and it\u2019s shocking when you look at the numbers.\u00a0 \u00a0 twelve years ago, when president obama and i came into office, the very first law we enacted was the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, and lilly was standing at our side.\u00a0 \u00a0 this year \u2014 that year, i should say, in 2009, we marked \u2014 equal pay day occurred in late april.\u00a0 by late april, women will have made, at that time, on average, what men make in 12 months.\u00a0 they had to go all the way through january, february, march, and april to catch up.\u00a0 that meant that it took women until april of 2009 to earn the same amount of money that a man made in all of 2008.\u00a0 \u00a0 another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12.\u00a0 and more than three extra months \u2014 it\u2019s more than that.\u00a0 and it\u2019s even longer for women of color.\u00a0 and it\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 \u00a0 this year, equal pay day falls in late march, which is a little bit better, but not much \u2014 from late april to late march.\u00a0 and, frankly, we shouldn\u2019t be satisfied until equal pay day is no longer even necessary to mention at all.\u00a0 \u00a0 the reality though is that in nearly every job \u2014 more than 90 percent of the occupations \u2014 women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar on average.\u00a0 for aapi women, it\u2019s 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns.\u00a0 for black women, it\u2019s 63 cents.\u00a0 for native american women, it\u2019s 60 cents.\u00a0 for hispanic women, it\u2019s 55 cents.\u00a0 \u00a0 it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real.\u00a0 and this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay. \u00a0 you know, as jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem.\u00a0 women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they\u2019re still earning less.\u00a0 \u00a0 more than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started \u2014 2 million.\u00a0 and now we\u2019re at the lowest rate of women participation in the labor force that we\u2019ve been in more than 30 years.\u00a0 let me say it again: the lowest \u2014 the lowest percent of women in the workforce \u2014 had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today. \u00a0 a lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and responsibility is falling on their shoulders.\u00a0 it causes women to miss work, cut hours, and leave their jobs and care for their children and aging loved ones.\u00a0 that in and of itself sows some discrimination.\u00a0 how many men are staying home and doing it, and the woman\u2019s staying in the workforce? \u00a0 it undermines financial security.\u00a0 and, by the way, it\u2019s hard.\u00a0 i was a single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were killed well over 40 years ago.\u00a0 and the fact of the matter is, i was a u.s. senator.\u00a0 i was 29 years old.\u00a0 i was making $42,000 a year, and i couldn\u2019t afford help to take care of my kids while i worked.\u00a0 thankful- \u2014 thankfully, my mother \u2014 my sister gave up her job.\u00a0 my brother \u2014 they helped me raise my kids.\u00a0 \u00a0 it undermines financial security for women and families.\u00a0 it hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people. \u00a0 in the american rescue plan you\u2019ve heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge.\u00a0 it puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks for 85 percent of american households.\u00a0 the hundredth million check has been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way.\u00a0 \u00a0 it also expanded the child care tax credit. and here\u2019s what that means, for those who don\u2019t know: right now, if you file for federal income tax, you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child.\u00a0 but if you need help the most, if you\u2019re making a minimum wage job and you don\u2019t have to \u2014 you don\u2019t make enough to pay federal income tax, then you don\u2019t get this credit.\u00a0 \u00a0 but because of the american rescue plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you\u2019re making $7.25 an hour \u2014 which is the minimum wage that so many people are making \u2014 you\u2019ll get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200.\u00a0 roughly, you get $500 a month mailed to you by the federal government.\u00a0 that\u2019s life-changing.\u00a0 \u00a0 the american rescue plan is going to cut poverty across the board in america by about 31 percent.\u00a0 and that\u2019s a significant lift up for women.\u00a0 the law provides $360 billion for funding state and local governments.\u00a0 what that means is that\u2019s going to prevent layoffs on jobs often held by women \u2014 nurses, teachers, healthcare workers, home healthcare aides \u2014 because the states have to balance their budget, because if they can\u2019t \u2014 because of the lack of income coming in without the help from the federal government \u2014 they\u2019ll have to lay off those essential workers. \u00a0 and the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40 billion for \u2014 invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic.\u00a0 all this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families. \u00a0 but there\u2019s so much more we need to do.\u00a0 so much more.\u00a0 we need the congress to pass the paycheck fairness act \u2014 the bill to remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities.\u00a0 it would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination.\u00a0 it would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group.\u00a0 it would increase pay transparency.\u00a0 \u00a0 by that, i mean, you know, there\u2019s a whole range of american corporations \u2014 if you sign the fortune 500 \u2014 you sign up with them, you cannot reveal \u2014 it says in your contract you cannot reveal your salary to another employee.\u00a0 why is that?\u00a0 they don\u2019t want me sitting there saying, \u201cwell, i\u2019m making $60,000.\u201d\u00a0 and the woman doing the same job, and she looks and said, \u201cyou\u2019re making 60?\u00a0 i\u2019m making 40.\u201d\u00a0 they actually try to hide it.\u00a0 that\u2019s what i mean by transparency.\u00a0 \u00a0 some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like i said, how much the person sitting next to you is making.\u00a0 some may even discipline you for asking that.\u00a0 that has to change.\u00a0 \u00a0 too often, secrecy is part of the problem.\u00a0 we know information is power.\u00a0 you can\u2019t solve the problem if you don\u2019t know you\u2019re not getting paid fairly.\u00a0 \u00a0 my administration is going to fight for equal pay \u2014 for it to become a reality for all women.\u00a0 it\u2019s about justice.\u00a0 it\u2019s about fairness.\u00a0 it\u2019s about living up to our values and who we are as a nation.\u00a0 equal pay makes all of us stronger. \u00a0 it\u2019s not just women who care about this.\u00a0 i\u2019ve been around the country.\u00a0 i\u2019ve gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, \u201chow many of you \u2014 how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn\u2019t earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?\u201d\u00a0 and you hear them say \u2014 you hear them respond they don\u2019t like it.\u00a0 why?\u00a0 when your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she\u2019s standing next is making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, you can replace it.\u00a0 you can get four new tires on the car.\u00a0 it means everybody\u2019s life is made better in that family.\u00a0 \u00a0 let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women\u2019s wages even more than they lift men\u2019s; and by investing our care\u00a0\u2014 in our care infrastructure \u2014 our care infrastructure \u2014 in paid leave, childcare, homecare \u2014 so that people can care for their families and also go to work.\u00a0 \u00a0 there\u2019s a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons.\u00a0 and if we\u2019re able to do this, it\u2019ll be transformational for our nation. \u00a0that\u2019s the goal.\u00a0 that\u2019s what this is all about.\u00a0 that\u2019s what this team, all of you, are all about. \u00a0 let me make one more point.\u00a0 you know, i\u2019ve told my daughters, granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what i was saying \u2014 and i mean it: there\u2019s not a single thing a man can do that a woman can\u2019t do as well or better.\u00a0 not a single thing.\u00a0 \u00a0 i was among the first senators ever to appoint a woman to the naval academy.\u00a0 i was just able to, as president of the united states, appoint two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders.\u00a0 three out of the six are combatant commanders, and they\u2019re women.\u00a0 women.\u00a0 there are so many, some in the congress, who were jet fighter pilots flying at twice the speed of sound.\u00a0 so many doing so much.\u00a0 \u00a0 but this soccer team, america\u2019s team, has done more to lift up people\u2019s sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above anything that\u2019s been done.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, as president of the united states, i thank you.\u00a0 i thank you for the example you\u2019ve set and for your willingness to say, \u201clook, we\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u00a0 we\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\u00a0 figuratively speaking, \u201cyou can take my trophies, but you can\u2019t take my pride.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 as i said, my dad used to say, \u201cjoey, a job is\u2026\u201d \u2014 when he lost his job and had to get another one.\u00a0 we had to move.\u00a0 he\u2019d say, \u201cyou know, joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.\u00a0 it\u2019s about your dignity.\u00a0 it\u2019s about respect.\u00a0 it\u2019s about your sense of yourself and your self-worth.\u00a0 it\u2019s about your place in the community.\u201d\u00a0 that\u2019s what this is all about, and that\u2019s why you guys are leading the way.\u00a0 \u00a0 and now it\u2019s my great pleasure and honor \u2014 i\u2019d like you to stand next to me, if you would, while i sign a proclamation making equal pay day \u2014 naming it \u2014 an expression of our commitment to seek equal pay as we build back better and restore this economic growth.\u00a0 \u00a0 thank you, folks.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to sign it now.\u00a0 come on over here.\u00a0 \u00a0 the title of the proclamation is \u201cnational equal pay day 2021.\u201d \u00a0 the first lady:\u00a0 you can move up.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 ms.

sent vaccines directly to local pharmacies and community health centers that disproportionately serve vulnerable populations; launched hundreds of mobile clinics to meet people where they are; and created the covid-19 health equity task force. these actions are garnering initial results. in the past two months, 60 percent of doses at federally-run community vaccination sites were administered to people of color. in the federal retail pharmacy program, 45 percent of sites were located in zip codes with high social vulnerability scores \u2013 a cdc index that uses 15 u.s. census variables to identify communities that may need support. finally, over 65 percent of the federal doses allocated to community health centers have been administered to people of color. but there is more work to do.\u00a0 that is why we\u2019re doubling down on the progress we are seeing through federal programs. today\u2019s announcements include: $6 billion investment in community health centers to expand access to vaccines in underserved communities.\u00a0 hhs will invest more than $6 billion from the american rescue plan into community health centers nationwide to expand covid-19 vaccinations, testing, and treatment for vulnerable populations; deliver preventive and primary health care services to people at higher risk for covid-19; and expand health centers\u2019 operational capacity during the pandemic and beyond, including modifying and improving physical infrastructure and adding mobile units. \u00a0the health resources and services administration (hrsa), will provide funding starting in april to nearly 1,400 centers across the country. community health centers serve 1 in 5 people living in rural communities. more than 91% of health center patients are individuals or families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, and more than 60% are racial or ethnic minorities. for detailed information on how this funding is being distributed to health centers nationwide, including state-by-state breakdowns and an interactive health center funding map, please visit:\u00a0 https://bphc.hrsa.gov/program-opportunities/american-rescue-plan/awards . expanding eligibility for vaccines to patients served by community health centers . in addition to today\u2019s historic investment in community health centers, community health centers participating in the federal health center covid-19 vaccine program are invited to expand eligibility to populations in the acip\u2019s 1c eligibility tier \u2013 this includes frontline essential workers and all persons 16 years and older with high-risk medical conditions. this means approximately 83% of the adults seen at community health centers participating in the federal health center covid-19 vaccine program will now be eligible for vaccinations. this follows the president\u2019s announcement that all adults will be eligible for vaccinations no later than may 1. today\u2019s news will enable more people in need to receive vaccine doses. $3 billion to strengthen vaccine confidence. \u00a0hhs, through the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), will invest $3 billion to support local efforts to increase vaccine uptake and equity. this funding will go directly to states, territories, and some large cities, enabling them to support local health departments and community-based organizations in launching new programs and initiatives intended to increase vaccine access, acceptance, and uptake. this funding will focus on reaching communities hit hardest by the pandemic, including those with a high social vulnerability index, minority communities, and rural areas. the awards will be made in early april and administered through cdc\u2019s existing immunization cooperative agreement with 64 jurisdictions. more than half of this funding is being made available thanks to the american rescue plan. examples of new programs this funding to jurisdictions could support include: launch a partnership to vaccinate dialysis patients.\u00a0 the administration is announcing a new partnership with dialysis clinics to provide covid-19 vaccinations to people receiving dialysis and health care personnel in outpatient dialysis clinics. kidney disease disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities as 34% of patients on dialysis are black and 19% are hispanic. people on dialysis who contract covid-19 often have severe health outcomes and have a 50% hospitalization rate and a mortality rate between 20-30% from covid-19. there are about 500,000 people in the u.s. who receive regular dialysis treatment. through this partnership, the administration will provide vaccines directly to dialysis treatment centers so patients who typically go three times a week for treatment are able to get vaccinated at their place of care. $330 million to invest in community health workers.\u00a0 hhs, through cdc, will provide $300 million to jurisdictions for community health worker services to support covid-19 prevention and control, and an additional $32 million for training, technical assistance, and evaluation. this funding will be used to address disparities in access to covid-19 related services, such as testing, contact tracing, and vaccinations, and it will help address factors that increase risk of severe covid-19 illness such as chronic diseases, pregnancy, and food insecurity. for example, this funding could support nurses who are serving hard-hit areas or local community health workers conducting outreach efforts to make those at highest risk aware of vaccination opportunities. this effort will benefit populations with increased prevalence of covid-19 and disproportionately impacted by long-standing health disparities related to sociodemographic characteristics, geographic regions, and economic strata. ###"},

roberts, vice president harris, speaker pelosi, leader schumer, leader mcconnell, vice president pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow americans. this is america\u2019s day. this is democracy\u2019s day. a day of history and hope. of renewal and resolve. through a crucible for the ages america has been tested anew and america has risen to the challenge. today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. we have learned again that democracy is precious. democracy is fragile. and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. so now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this capitol\u2019s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under god, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. we look ahead in our uniquely american way \u2013 restless, bold, optimistic \u2013 and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. i thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. i thank them from the bottom of my heart. you know the resilience of our constitution and the strength of our nation. as does president carter, who i spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. i have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took \u2014 an oath first sworn by george washington. but the american story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. on \u201cwe the people\u201d who seek a more perfect union. this is a great nation and we are a good people. over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. but we still have far to go. we will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. much to repair. much to restore. much to heal. much to build. and much to gain. few periods in our nation\u2019s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we\u2019re in now. a once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country. it\u2019s taken as many lives in one year as america lost in all of world war ii. millions of jobs have been lost. hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. the dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. a cry for survival comes from the planet itself. a cry that can\u2019t be any more desperate or any more clear. and now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. to overcome these challenges \u2013 to restore the soul and to secure the future of america \u2013 requires more than words. it requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: unity. unity. in another january in washington, on new year\u2019s day 1863, abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation. when he put pen to paper, the president said, \u201cif my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.\u201d my whole soul is in it. today, on this january day, my whole soul is in this: bringing america together. uniting our people. and uniting our nation. i ask every american to join me in this cause. uniting to fight the common foes we face: anger, resentment, hatred. extremism, lawlessness, violence. disease, joblessness, hopelessness. with unity we can do great things. important things. we can right wrongs. we can put people to work in good jobs. we can teach our children in safe schools. we can overcome this deadly virus. we can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all. we can deliver racial justice. we can make america, once again, the leading force for good in the world. i know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. i know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. but i also know they are not new. our history has been a constant struggle between the american ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. the battle is perennial. victory is never assured. through the civil war, the great depression, world war, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our \u201cbetter angels\u201d have always prevailed. in each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. and, we can do so now. history, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. we can treat each other with dignity and respect. we can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. for without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. no progress, only exhausting outrage. no nation, only a state of chaos. this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. and, we must meet this moment as the united states of america. if we do that, i guarantee you, we will not fail. we have never, ever, ever failed in america when we have acted together. and so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh. all of us. let us listen to one another. hear one another. see one another. show respect to one another. politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war. and, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. my fellow americans, we have to be different than this. america has to be better than this. and, i believe america is better than this. just look around. here we stand, in the shadow of a capitol dome that was completed amid the civil war, when the union itself hung in the balance. yet we endured and we prevailed. here we stand looking out to the great mall where dr. king spoke of his dream. here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in american history elected to national office \u2013 vice president kamala harris. don\u2019t tell me things can\u2019t change. here we stand across the potomac from arlington national cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. and here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground. that did not happen. it will never happen. not today. not tomorrow. not ever. to all those who supported our campaign i am humbled by the faith you have placed in us. to all those who did not support us, let me say this: hear me out as we move forward. take a measure of me and my heart. and if you still disagree, so be it. that\u2019s democracy. that\u2019s america. the right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our republic, is perhaps our nation\u2019s greatest strength. yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion. and i pledge this to you: i will be a president for all americans. i will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. many centuries ago, saint augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. what are the common objects we love that define us as americans? i think i know. opportunity. security. liberty. dignity. respect. honor. and, yes, the truth. recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. there is truth and there are lies. lies told for power and for profit. and each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as americans, and especially as leaders \u2013 leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation \u2014 to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. i understand that many americans view the future with some fear and trepidation. i understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next. i get it. but the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don\u2019t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don\u2019t get their news from the same sources you do. we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. if we show a little tolerance and humility. if we\u2019re willing to stand in the other person\u2019s shoes just for a moment. because here is the thing about life: there is no accounting for what fate will deal you. there are some days when we need a hand. there are other days when we\u2019re called on to lend one. that is how we must be with one another. and, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. my fellow americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. we will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. we are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. we must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. i promise you this: as the bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. we will get through this, together the world is watching today. so here is my message to those beyond our borders: america has been tested and we have come out stronger for it. we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. not to meet yesterday\u2019s challenges, but today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s. we will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example. we will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. we have been through so much in this nation. and, in my first act as president, i would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. to those 400,000 fellow americans \u2013 mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. we will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country. amen. this is a time of testing. we face an attack on democracy and on truth. a raging virus. growing inequity. the sting of systemic racism. a climate in crisis. america\u2019s role in the world. any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. but the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities. now we must step up. all of us. it is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. and, this is certain. we will be judged, you and i, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era. will we rise to the occasion? will we master this rare and difficult hour? will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children? i believe we must and i believe we will. and when we do, we will write the next chapter in the american story. it\u2019s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. it\u2019s called \u201camerican anthem\u201d and there is one verse stands out for me: \u201cthe work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day what shall be our legacy? what will our children say?\u2026 let me know in my heart when my days are through america america i gave my best to you.\u201d let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. if we do this then when our days are through our children and our children\u2019s children will say of us they gave their best. they did their duty. they healed a broken land. my fellow americans, i close today where i began, with a sacred oath. before god and all of you i give you my word. i will always level with you. i will defend the constitution. i will defend our democracy. i will defend america. i will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities. not of personal interest, but of the public good. and together, we shall write an american story of hope, not fear. of unity, not division. of light, not darkness. an american story of decency and dignity. of love and of healing. of greatness and of goodness. may this be the story that guides us. the story that inspires us. the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. we met the moment. that democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived. that our america secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. that is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. so, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. sustained by faith. driven by conviction. and, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts. may god bless america and may god protect our troops. thank you, america. end 12:13 pm est"}
