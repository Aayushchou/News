thank you. good afternoon. before i take questions, i want to make \u2014 give you a progress report to the nation on where we stand 65 days into office here on vaccinations and a few other top priorities for the american people. first, on vaccinations: on december 8th, i indicated that i hoped to get 100 million shots in people\u2019s arms in my first 100 days. we met that goal last week by day 58 \u2014 42 days ahead of schedule. now, today, i\u2019m setting a second goal, and that is: we will, by my 100th day in office, have administered 200 million shots in people\u2019s arms. that\u2019s right: 200 million shots in 100 days. i know it\u2019s ambitious, twice our original goal, but no other country in the world has even come close \u2014 not even close \u2014 to what we are doing. and i believe we can do it. and today, we\u2019ve made a historic investment in reaching the hardest-hit and the most vulnerable communities, the highest-risk communities \u2014 as a consequence of the virus \u2014 by investing an addition $10 billion in being able to reach them. i also set a goal, before i took office, of getting a majority of schools in k through 8 fully open in the first 100 days. now, thanks to the enormous amount of work done by our administration, educators, parents, local, state education officials and leaders \u2014 a recent department of education department survey shows that nearly half of the k-through-8 schools are open now full time, five days a week, for in-person learning. not yet a majority, but we\u2019re really close. and i believe, in the 35 days left to go, we\u2019ll meet that goal as well. as of yesterday, more than 100 million payments of $1,400 have gone into people\u2019s bank accounts. that\u2019s real money in people\u2019s pockets, bringing relief instantly, almost. and millions more will be getting their money very soon. one final note: since we passed the american rescue plan, we\u2019re starting to see new signs of hope in our economy. since it was passed, a majority \u2014 a majority of economic forecasters have significantly increased their projections on the economic growth that\u2019s going to take place this year. they\u2019re now projecting it will exceed 6 percent \u2014 a 6 percent growth in gdp. and just this morning, we learned that the number of people filing for weekly unemployment insurance fell by nearly 100,000 persons. that\u2019s the first time in a year the number has fallen below the pre-pandemic high. so there are still too many americans out of work, too many families hurting, and we still have a lot of work to do. but i can say to you, the american people: help is here, and hope is on the way. now i\u2019ll be happy to take your questions. zeke, the associated press. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president. you mentioned your progress on covid-19. i\u2019d like to ask you about some of the other issues facing your presidency. one of the defining challenges you face in the coming months is how to deliver on your promise to americans on issues like immigration reform, gun control, voting rights, climate change. all of those right now are facing stiff, united opposition from republicans on capitol hill. how far are you willing to go to achieve those promises that you made to the american people? the president: well, i\u2019m going to \u2014 look, when i took office, i decided that it was a fairly basic, simple proposition, and that is: i got elected to solve problems. and the most urgent problem facing the american people, i stated from the outset, was covid-19 and the economic dislocation for millions and millions of americans. and so that\u2019s why i put all my focus in the beginning \u2014 there are a lot of problems \u2014 put all my focus on dealing with those particular problems. and the other problems we\u2019re talking about, from immigration to guns and the other things you mentioned, are long-term problems; they\u2019ve been around a long time. and what we\u2019re going to be able to do, god willing, is now begin, one at a time, to focus on those as well, and \u2014 whether it\u2019s immigration or guns or a number of other problems that face the country. but the fundamental problem is getting people some peace of mind so they can go to bed at night and not stare at the ceiling wondering whether they lost their health insurance, whether they\u2019re going to lose a family member, whether they\u2019re going to be in a position where they\u2019re not going to be \u2014 they\u2019re going to lose their home because they can\u2019t pay their mortgage, or that millions of people are going to get thrown out of their homes because of the inability to \u2014 to pay their rent. so we\u2019re going to move on these one at a time, try to do as many simultaneously as we can. but that\u2019s the reason why i focused as i have. and here\u2019s the deal: i think my republican colleagues are going to have to determine whether or not we want to work together, or they decide that the way in which they want to proceed is to \u2014 is to just decide to divide the country, continue the politics of division. but i\u2019m not going to do that; i\u2019m just going to move forward and take these things as they come. q\u00a0 and just to \u2014 to follow up, mr. president, can your presidency be a success if you can\u2019t make progress on those four challenges: climate change, immigration reform, gun control, voting rights? the president: well, i plan on making progress on all of them, but that\u2019s going to be for the american people to decide. i think \u2014 you know, i doubt whether \u2014 maybe you did; maybe others did. i thought \u2014 many of you thought there was no possibility of my getting the plan i got passed, passed, without any republican votes. a pretty big deal. it got passed. growing the economy. people\u2019s lives are changing. so let\u2019s see what happens. all i know, i\u2019ve been hired to solve problems \u2014 to solve problems, not create division. okay. how about yamiche? q\u00a0 thanks so much, mr. president. you\u2019ve said over and over again that immigrants shouldn\u2019t come to this country right now; this isn\u2019t the time to come. that message is not being received. instead, the perception of you that got you elected \u2014 as a moral, decent man \u2014 is the reason why a lot of immigrants are coming to this country and entrusting you with unaccompanied minors. how do you resolve that tension? and how are you choosing which families can stay and which can go, given the fact that even though, with title 42, there are some families that are staying? and is there a timeline for when we won\u2019t be seeing these overcrowded facilities with \u2014 run by cpb [sic], when it comes to unaccompanied minors? the president: well, look, i guess i should be flattered people are coming because i\u2019m the nice guy; that\u2019s the reason why it\u2019s happening \u2014 that i\u2019m a decent man or however it\u2019s phrased. that \u2014 you know, that\u2019s why they\u2019re coming, because they know biden is a good guy. the truth of the matter is: nothing has changed. as many people came \u2014 28 percent increase in children to the border in my administration; 31 percent in the last year of \u2014 in 2019, before the pandemic, in the trump administration. it happens every single, solitary year: there is a significant increase in the number of people coming to the border in the winter months of january, february, march. that happens every year. in addition to that, there is a \u2014 and nobody \u2014 and, by the way, does anybody suggest that there was a 31 percent increase under trump because he was a nice guy and he was doing good things at the border? that\u2019s not the reason they\u2019re coming. the reason they\u2019re coming is that it\u2019s the time they can travel with the least likelihood of dying on the way because of the heat in the desert, number one. number two, they\u2019re coming because of the circumstances in-country \u2014 in-country. the way to deal with this problem \u2014 and i started to deal with it back when i was a united states senator \u2014 i mean, vice president \u2014 putting together a bipartisan plan of over $700 million to deal with the root causes of why people are leaving. what did trump do? he eliminated that funding. he didn\u2019t use it. he didn\u2019t do it. and in addition to that, what he did \u2014 he dismantled all the elements that exist to deal with what had been a problem and \u2014 and has been \u2014 continued to be a problem for a long time. he, in fact, shut down the \u2014 the number of beds available. he did not fund hhs to get people to get the children out of those \u2014 those border patrol facilities where they should not be and not supposed to be more than a few days \u2014 a little while. but he dismantled all of that. and so what we\u2019re doing now is attempting to rebuild \u2014 rebuild the system that can accommodate the \u2014 what is happening today. and i like to think it\u2019s because i\u2019m a nice guy, but it\u2019s not. it\u2019s because of what\u2019s happened every year. let me say one other thing on this. if you take a look at the number of people who are coming, the vast majority, the overwhelming majority of people coming to the border and crossing are being sent back \u2014 are being sent back. thousands \u2014 tens of thousands of people who are \u2014 who are over 18 years of age and single \u2014 people, one at a time coming, have been sent back, sent home. we\u2019re sending back the vast majority of the families that are coming. we\u2019re trying to work out now, with mexico, their willingness to take more of those families back. but we \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s happening. they\u2019re not getting across the border. and those who are coming across the border, who are unaccompanied children, we\u2019re moving rapidly to try to put in place what was dismantled, as i said. for example, of all the children who are coming across the border, over 70 percent are either 16 or 17 years old. we\u2019re not talking about people ripping babies from mothers\u2019 arms or little three-year-olds standing on the border. less than \u2014 i think it\u2019s one and a half percent fall in the category of the very young. so what we\u2019re doing is we\u2019re providing for the space, again, to be able to get these kids out of the border patrol facilities, which no child \u2014 no one should be in any longer than 72 hours. and today, i went to \u2014 for example, i used all the resources available to me, went to the defense department, and \u2014 and the secretary of defense has just made available fort bliss \u2014 5,000 beds be made easily available. five thousand beds on the texas border. so we\u2019re building back up the capacity that should have been maintained and built upon that trump dismantled. it\u2019s going to take time. and the other thing we\u2019re doing, i might add \u2014 am i giving you too long an answer? because if you don\u2019t want the details \u2014 q\u00a0 (inaudible.) the president: no, no, but i mean \u2014 i don\u2019t know how much detail you want about immigration. maybe i\u2019ll stop there and fin- \u2014 q\u00a0 my follow-up question is: one, if you could talk a little bit about which families \u2014 why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. the families that are being allowed to stay, why they\u2019re being allowed to stay. and in addition to that, when it comes to the filibuster, which is what zeke was asking about, there\u2019s \u2014 immigration is a big issue, of course, when it \u2014 related to the filibuster, but there\u2019s also republicans who are passing bill after bill, trying to restrict voting rights. chuck schumer is calling it an \u201cexistential threat\u201d to democracy. why not back a filibuster rule that at least gets around issues including voting rights or immigration? jim clyburn, someone who \u2014 of course, who you know very well, has backed the idea of a filibuster rule when it comes to civil rights and voting rights. the president: well, look, i\u2019m going to deal with all of those problems. the question is, the priorities as they come and land on my plate. let\u2019s go to the first question you asked \u2014 the first of the second question you asked. and that is: what about dealing with families? why are not \u2014 some not going back? because mexico is refusing to take them back. they\u2019re saying they won\u2019t take them back \u2014 not all of them. we\u2019re in negotiations with the president of mexico. i think we\u2019re going to see that change. they should all be going back, all be going back. the only people we\u2019re not going to let sitting there on the other side of the rio grande by themselves with no help are children. and what we\u2019re doing there, and it\u2019s an important point to understand \u2014 i know you understand; i don\u2019t mean to say it that way \u2014 an important point to focus on: the vast majority of people under the age of 18 coming to united states come with a telephone number on a wristband or come with a telephone number in their pocket in the united states \u2014 a mother, a father, a close relative, a grandmom or a grandpop. what was happening before is it was taking literally weeks and weeks, and maybe even months, before anybody would pick up the phone and call to see if there really was someone there. well, we\u2019ve set up a system now where, within 24 hours, there\u2019s a phone call made as that person or that child crosses the border. and then a verification system is being put in place as of today to determine quickly whether or not that is a trafficker being called or that is actually a mom, a dad, and/or a close relative. they\u2019re establishing that right off the bat. if it, in fact, is mom or dad, dad says \u2014 to take the extreme case \u2014 \u201ci got a birth certificate.\u201d then guess what? we\u2019re getting that kid directly to that parent immediately. and so that\u2019s going to reduce significantly \u2014 there\u2019s two ways to reduce child populations in circumstances that are not acceptable, like being held at a border patrol station. one is to get them to the place where they have a relative and set a date as to when a hearing can be held. the second way to do it is put them in a health and human services facility that we\u2019re occupying now \u2014 both licensed beds around the country that exist, as well as, for example, federal resources like fort bliss \u2014 to get them safely in a place where they can be taken care of while their fate is determined. q\u00a0 and can you answer the filibuster (inaudible)? the president: filibuster. filibuster. you know, with regard to the filibuster, i believe we should go back to a position on the filibuster that existed just when i came to the united states senate 120 years ago. and that is that \u2014 it used to be required for the filibuster \u2014 and i had a card on this; i was going to give you the statistics, but you probably know them \u2014 that it used to be that, that from between 1917 to 1971 \u2014 the filibuster existed \u2014 there was a total of 58 motions to break a filibuster that whole time. last year alone, there were five times that many. so it\u2019s being abused in a gigantic way. and, for example, it used to be you had to stand there and talk and talk and talk and talk until you collapsed. and guess what? people got tired of talking and tired of collapsing. filibusters broke down, and we were able to break the filibuster, get a quorum, and vote. so i strongly support moving in that direction, in addition to having an open mind about dealing with certain things that are \u2014 are just elemental to the functioning of our democracy, like the right to vote \u2014 like the basic right to vote. we\u2019ve amended the filibuster in the past. but here\u2019s the deal: as you observed, i\u2019m a fairly practical guy. i want to get things done. i want to get them done, consistent with what we promised the american people. and in order to do that in a 50-50 senate, we\u2019ve got to get to the place where i get 50 votes so that the vice president of the united states can break the tie, or i get 51 votes without her. and so, i\u2019m going to say something outrageous: i have never been particularly poor at calculating how to get things done in the united states senate. so the best way to get something done, if you \u2014 if you hold near and dear to you that you like to be able to \u2014 anyway \u2014 i \u2014 we\u2019re going to get a lot done. and if we have to \u2014 if there\u2019s complete lockdown and chaos as a consequence of the filibuster, then we\u2019ll have to go beyond what i\u2019m talking about. okay. hang on. sorry. oh, seung min \u2014 ms. kim. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president, to follow up on the filibuster: so do you believe it should take 60 votes to end a filibuster on legislation or 51? the president: (laughs.) if we could end it with 51, we would have no problem. you\u2019re going to have to \u2014 the existing rule \u2014 it\u2019s going to be hard to get a parliamentary ruling that allows 50 votes to end the filibuster, the existence of a filibuster. but it\u2019s not my expertise, in what the parliamentary rules and how to get there are. but our preoccupation with the filibuster is totally legitimate, but in the meantime, we got a lot we can do while we\u2019re talking about what we\u2019re going to do about the filibuster. let me get here. okay, cecilia vega. \u00a0 q\u00a0 i\u2019d like to circle back to immigration, please. you just listed the reasons that people are coming, talking about in-country problems, saying that it happens every year; you blamed the last administration. sir, i just got back last night from a reporting trip to the border where i met nine-year-old, yossell, who walked here from honduras by himself, along with another little boy. he had that phone number on him \u2014 the president: astounding. q\u00a0 \u2014 and we were able to call his family. his mother says that she sent her son to this country because she believes that you are not deporting unaccompanied minors like her son. that\u2019s why she sent him alone from honduras. so, sir, you blamed the last administration, but is your messaging \u2014 in saying that these children are and will be allowed to stay in this country and work their way through this process \u2014 encouraging families like yossell says to come? the president: well, look, the idea that i\u2019m going to say \u2014 which i would never do \u2014 \u201cif an unaccompanied child ends up at the border, we\u2019re just going to let him starve to death and stay on the other side\u201d \u2014\u00a0no previous administration did that either, except trump. i\u2019m not going to do it. i\u2019m not going to do it. that\u2019s why i\u2019ve asked the vice president of the united states, yesterday, to be the lead person on dealing with focusing on the fundamental reasons why people leave honduras, guatemala, and el salvador in the first place. it\u2019s because of earthquakes, floods. it\u2019s because of lack of food. it\u2019s because of gang violence. it\u2019s because of a whole range of things. that \u2014 when i was vice president and had the same obligation to deal with unaccompanied children, i was able to get it slowed up significantly by working with the heads of state of those communities to do things like \u2014 in one of the major cities, the reason people were leaving is they couldn\u2019t walk in the street because they were getting \u2014 their kids were getting beat up or shot or in gang violence. well, what i was able to do is not give money to the head of state, because so many are corrupt, but i was able to say, \u201cokay, you need lighting in the streets to change things? i\u2019ll put the lighting in.\u201d we got a contractor. we got the type of lighting. we paid directly to the contractor; it did not go through the government. and violent crime significantly was reduced in that city. fewer people sought to leave. when this hurricane occurred \u2014 two hurricanes \u2014 instead of us going down and helping in a major way, so that people would not have reason to want to leave in the first place because they didn\u2019t have housing or water or sustenance, we did nothing. we\u2019re going to do a lot in our administration. we\u2019re going to be spending that 700-plus million dollars a year to change the life and circumstances of why people leave in the first place. that mother did not sit around with \u2014 on the kitchen table and say, \u201cyou know, i got a great idea: the way i\u2019m going to make sure my son get taken care of is i\u2019m going to put a\u2026\u201d \u2014 how old was he, or she? q\u00a0 he\u2019s \u2014 he\u2019s nine. i also met a 10-year-old. the president: a nine-year-old. \u201ci\u2019m going to send him on a thousand-mile journey across the desert and up to the united states because i know joe biden is a nice guy and he\u2019ll take care of him.\u201d what a desperate act to have to take. the circumstances must be horrible. so we can do something about that. that\u2019s what the vice president is going to be doing: what i did. when president obama asked me to come and deal, i was in \u2014 i was in turkey at the time, and he said, \u201cyou got to come home and take care of this.\u201d so we put together a plan and it had an impact. and so, the question here is whether \u2014 how we go ahead and do this; what we do. there\u2019s no easy answer q\u00a0 a quick follow, if i may. \u00a0do you want to see these unaccompanied minors staying in this country, or should they be deported eventually? the president: well, the judgment has to be made whether or not \u2014 and in this young man\u2019s case, he has a mom at home; there\u2019s an overwhelming reason why he\u2019d be put in a plane and flown back to his mom. q\u00a0 final follow, sir. you mentioned circumstances that must be horrific. the customs and border protection facility in donna, texas \u2014 i was there \u2014 is at 1,556 percent capacity \u2014 the president: yep. q\u00a0 \u2014 right now, with mostly unaccompanied minors. there are kids that are sleeping on floors. they are packed into these pods. i\u2019ve spoken to lawyers who say that they \u2014 some of these children have not seen the sun in days. what\u2019s your reaction \u2014 what is your reaction to these images that have come out from that particular facility? is what\u2019s happening inside acceptable to you? and when is this going to be fixed? the president: is \u2014 that\u2019s a serious question, right? is it acceptable to me? come on. that\u2019s why we\u2019re going to be moving a thousand of those kids out quickly. that\u2019s why i got fort bliss opened up. that\u2019s why i\u2019ve been working from the moment this started to happen to try to find additional access for children to be able to safely \u2014 not just children, but particularly children \u2014 to be able to safely be housed while we follow through on the rest of what\u2019s happening. that is totally unacceptable. ken. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president. i wanted to ask you about afghanistan. you face a may 1st deadline for the withdrawal of u.s. troops from that country. as a candidate, in foreign affairs, you wrote that it is past time to end these forever wars. can you commit to the american people that by may 2nd the u.s. will no longer have forces in afghanistan? the president: the answer is that it\u2019s going to be hard to meet the may 1 deadline. just in terms of tactical reasons, it\u2019s hard to get those troops out. so, what we\u2019ve been doing \u2014 what i\u2019ve been doing and what secretary blinken has been doing \u2014 has been \u2014 we\u2019ve been meeting with our allies, those other nations that have nato allies who have troops in afghanistan as well. and if we leave, we\u2019re going to do so in a safe and orderly way. we\u2019re in consultation, i said, with our allies and partners in how to proceed. and secretary blinken is meeting in brussels this week with our nato allies, particularly those who have forces there. and general austin is \u2014 just met with ghani and i\u2019m waiting for the briefing on that. he is the \u2014 the \u201cleader,\u201d quote, in afghanistan and kabul. and there\u2019s a u.n.-led process that\u2019s beginning shortly on how to mechanically get people \u2014 how to end this war. but it is not my intention to stay there for a long time. but the question is: how and in what circumstances do we meet that agreement that was made by president trump to leave under a deal that looks like it\u2019s not being able to be worked out to begin with? how is that done? but we are not staying a long time. q\u00a0 you just said \u201cif we leave.\u201d do you think it\u2019s possible that we\u2013 the president: we will leave. the question is when we leave. q\u00a0 do you \u2014 sorry \u2014 do you believe, though, it\u2019s possible we could have troops there next year? the president: i \u2014 i can\u2019t picture that being the case. okay. kristen. q\u00a0 thank you very much, mr. president. given the conditions that were just laid out at the migrant facilities at the u.s. border, will you commit to allowing journalists to have access to the facilities that are overcrowded moving forward? the president: i will commit when my plan, very shortly, is underway to let you have access to not just them, but to other facilities as well. q\u00a0 how soon will journalists be able to have access to the facilities? we\u2019ve obviously been allowed to be inside one, but we haven\u2019t seen the facilities in which children are packed together to really give the american people a chance to see that. will you commit to transparency on this issue, mr. president? the president: i will commit to transparency, and \u2014 as soon as i am in a position to be able to implement what we are doing right now. and one of the reasons i haven\u2019t gone down \u2014 i have all my \u2014 my chief folks have gone down \u2014 is i don\u2019t want to become the issue. i don\u2019t want to be, you know, bringing all of the secret service and everybody with me to get in the way. so this is being set up, and you\u2019ll have full access to everything once we get this thing moving. q\u00a0 okay. and just to be clear: how soon will that be, mr. president? the president: i don\u2019t know, to be clear. q\u00a0 okay. and do you bear responsibility for everything that\u2019s happening at the border now? i hear you talking a lot about the past administration. you decided to roll back some of those policies, did you move too quickly to roll back (inaudible) policies? the president: to roll back what? i\u2019m sorry. q\u00a0 did you move too quickly to roll back some of the executive orders of your predecessor? the president: first of all, all the policies that were underway were not helping at all \u2014 did not slow up the amount of immigration \u2014 and there\u2019s many people coming. and rolling back the policies of separating children from \u2014 from their mothers, i make no apology for that. rolling back the policies of \u201cremain in mexico,\u201d sitting on the edge of the rio grande in a muddy circumstance with not enough to eat and \u2014 i make no apologies for that. i make no apologies for ending programs that did not exist before trump became president that have an incredibly negative impact on the law, international law, as well as on human dignity. and so, i make no apologies for that. q\u00a0 if i could just ask you about foreign policy, mr. president. overnight, we learned that north korea tested two ballistic missiles. what, if any, actions will you take? and what is your red line on north korea? the president: let me say that, number one, u.n. resolution 1718 was violated by those particular missiles that were tested \u2014 number one. we\u2019re consulting with our allies and partners. and there will be responses \u2014 if they choose to escalate, we will respond accordingly. but i\u2019m also prepared for some form of diplomacy, but it has to be conditioned upon the end result of denuclearization. so that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing right now: consulting with our allies. q\u00a0 just a very quick follow-up \u2014 the president: you\u2019ve only got another hour now, okay? q\u00a0 diplomacy: can you define what you mean? and former president obama warned the incoming president trump that north korea was the top foreign policy issue that he was watching. is that how you assess the crisis in north korea? the president: yes. okay. hang on a second here, kristen. nancy, cbs. q \u00a0thank you very much, mr. president. i want to go back to voting rights. and as yamiche mentioned, republican legislatures across the country are working to pass bills that would restrict voting, particularly, democrats fear, impacting minority voters and young voters \u2014 the very people who helped to get you elected in november. are you worried that if you don\u2019t manage to pass voting rights legislation that your party is going to lose seats and possibly lose control of the house and the senate in 2022? the president: what i\u2019m worried about is how un-american this whole initiative is. it\u2019s sick. it\u2019s sick. deciding in some states that you cannot bring water to people standing in line, waiting to vote; deciding that you\u2019re going to end voting at five o\u2019clock when working people are just getting off work; deciding that there will be no absentee ballots under the most rigid circumstances. it\u2019s all designed \u2014 and i\u2019m going to spend my time doing three things: one, trying to figure out how to pass the legislation passed by the house, number one. number two, educating the american public. the republican voters i know find this despicable. republican voters, the folks out in \u2014 outside this white house. i\u2019m not talking about the elected officials; i\u2019m talking about voters. voters. and so i am convinced that we\u2019ll be able to stop this because it is the most pernicious thing. this makes jim crow look like jim eagle. i mean, this is gigantic what they\u2019re trying to do, and it cannot be sustained. i\u2019m going to do everything in my power, along with my friends in the house and the senate, to keep that from \u2014 from becoming the law. q\u00a0 is there anything else you can do about it besides passing legislation? the president: the answer is \u201cyes,\u201d but i\u2019m not going to lay out a strategy in front of the whole world and you now. q\u00a0 and then, on a related note, have you decided whether you are going to run for reelection in 2024? you haven\u2019t set up a reelection campaign yet, as your predecessor had by this time. the president: (laughs.) my predecessor need do [sic] \u2014 needed to. my predecessor. oh god, i miss him. q\u00a0 have you \u2014 have you \u2014 the president: no, the answer is \u201cyes.\u201d my plan is to run for reelection. that\u2019s my expectation. q\u00a0 and then, on \u2014 on one other note, on bipartisanship: your old friend, mitch mcconnell, says you have only spoken to each other once since you took office and that you have moved far left since taking office. do you see it the same way he does? have you rejected bipartisanship? the president: no, i haven\u2019t at all. i\u2019ve been meeting \u2014 when is the last time a president invited the opposite party down at least a half a dozen times to talk about issues? everything from how we work \u2014 we\u2019re working with a group of 20 members of the senate right now and house on how we reestablish our ability to make computer chips and how we get ahead of the game, how we can work together. and we\u2019re working together on a bunch of things. but, look, i know mitch well; mitch knows me well. i would expect mitch to say exactly what he said. but this is a matter of making sure that \u2014 i would like republican \u2014 elected republican support, but what i know i have now is that i have electoral support from republican voters. republican voters agree with what i\u2019m doing. and so, unless mitch says the last thing i did is \u2014 the last piece of legislation is so far left \u2014 well, then he ought to a look at his party. over 50 percent of them must be over that edge as well because they support what i did. okay. where am i here? let me see. kaitlan. q\u00a0 thank you very much, mr. president. i have a question for you, but first i\u2019d like to follow up on a question from yamiche, and that\u2019s on the filibuster. the president: that counts as a question, but go ahead. q\u00a0 okay. i\u2019ll make it quick. it\u2019s a quick question. the president: no, no \u2014 you can. q\u00a0 regarding the filibuster: at john lewis\u2019s funeral, president barack obama said he believed the filibuster was a \u201crelic\u201d of the jim crow era. do you agree? the president: yes. q\u00a0 and if not, why not abolish it if it\u2019s a relic of the jim crow era? the president: successful electoral politics is the art of the possible. let\u2019s figure out how we can get this done and move in the direction of significantly changing the abuse of even the filibuster rule first. it\u2019s been abused from the time it came into being \u2014 by an extreme way in the last 20 years. let\u2019s deal with the abuse first. q\u00a0 it sounds like you\u2019re moving closer to eliminating the filibuster. is that correct? the president: i answered your question. q\u00a0 you also just made some news by saying that you are going to run for reelection. the president: i said, \u201cthat is my expectation.\u201d q\u00a0 so is that a \u201cyes\u201d that you are running for reelection? the president: look, i \u2014 i don\u2019t know where you guys come from, man. i\u2019ve never been able to travel. i\u2019m a great respecter of fate. i\u2019ve never been able to plan four and half, three and a half years ahead for certain. q\u00a0 and if you do \u2014 the president: it \u2014 q\u00a0 if you do run, will vice president harris be on your ticket? the president: i would fully expect that to be the case. she\u2019s doing a great job. she\u2019s a great partner. she\u2019s a great partner. q\u00a0 and do you believe you\u2019ll be running against former president trump? the president: oh, come on. i don\u2019t even think about \u2014 i don\u2019t \u2014 i have no idea. i have no idea if there will be a republican party. do you? i know you don\u2019t have to answer my question, but, i mean, you know, do you? i mean, look, this is \u2014 the way i view things \u2014 i\u2019ve become a great respecter of fate in my life. i set a goal that\u2019s in front of me to get things done for the people i care most about, which are hardworking, decent american people who are getting \u2014 really having it stuck to them. i want to change the paradigm. i want to change the paradigm. we start to reward work, not just wealth. i want to change the paradigm. if you notice \u2014 don\u2019t you find it kind of interesting that my republican friends were worried about that the cost and the taxes that had to be had \u2014 if there is any tax to be had, as they talk about it \u2014 in dealing with the \u2014 the act that we just passed which puts money in people\u2019s pockets \u2014 ordinary people. did you hear them complain when they passed close to a $2 trillion trump tax cut \u2014 83 percent going to the top 1 percent? did you hear them talk about that all? i love the fact that they\u2019ve found this whole idea of concern about the federal budget. it\u2019s kind of amazing. when the federal budget is saving people\u2019s lives, they don\u2019t think it\u2019s such a good idea. when the federal budget is feathering the nest of the wealthiest americans \u2014 90 of the fortune 500 companies making billions of dollars not paying a cent in taxes; reducing taxes to the point that people who are making \u2014 you know, if you\u2019re a husband and wife, a schoolteacher and a cop, you\u2019re paying at a higher rate than the average person making a billion dollars a year is \u2014 something is wrong. their newfound concern. i\u2019m concerned \u2014 look, i meant what i said when i ran. and a lot of you still think i\u2019m wrong, and i respect that. i said, \u201ci\u2019m running for three reasons: to restore the soul, dignity, honor, honesty, transparency to the american political system; two, to rebuild the backbone of this country \u2014 the middle class, hardworking people, and people struggling to get in the middle class. they built america, and unions built them.\u201d the third reason i said i was running was to unite the country. and, generically speaking, all of you said, \u201cno, you can\u2019t do that.\u201d well, i\u2019ve not been able to unite the congress, but i\u2019ve been uniting the country, based on the polling data. we have to come together. we have to. so, from my perspective, you know, it\u2019s a \u2014 to me, it\u2019s about just, you know, getting out there, putting one foot in front of the other and just trying to make things better for people \u2014 just hardworking people. people get up every morning and just want to figure out how to put food on the table for their kids, to be able have a little bit of breathing room, being able to have \u2014 make sure that they go to bed not staring at the ceiling, like my dad, wondering whether \u2014 since he didn\u2019t have health insurance, what happens if mom gets sick or he got sick. these are basic things. basic things. and i\u2019m of the view that the vast majority of people, including registered republicans, by and large, share that \u2014 that same \u2014 that same view, that same sense of what is \u2014 you know, what\u2019s appropriate. justin. justin sink, bloomberg. q\u00a0 thanks, mr. president. i wanted to ask about your relationship with china now that you\u2019ve been in office for a couple months. there\u2019s obviously the meeting in alaska that was a little theatrical, and there\u2019s the continued human rights abuses. so, today, i\u2019m wondering: are you more likely than you were when you came into office to maintain tariffs on china? are you considering banning imports of forced-labor products? and would you consider cutting off u.s. investment or chinese access to international payment systems? the president: well, look, they\u2019re each specifically legitimate questions, but they only touch a smidgen of what the relationship with china really is about. i\u2019ve known xi jinping for a long time. allegedly, by the time i left office as vice president, i had spent more time with xi jinping than any world leader had, because president obama and the chinese president hu decided we should get to know one another since it was inappropriate for the president of the united states to spend time with the vice president of another country. but it was obvious he was going to become the new leader of china. so, i spent hours upon hours with him alone with an interpreter \u2014 my interpreter and his \u2014 going into great detail. he is very, very straightforward. doesn\u2019t have a democratic \u2014 with a small \u201cd\u201d \u2014 bone in his body. but he\u2019s a smart, smart guy. he\u2019s one of the guys, like putin, who thinks that autocracy is the wave of the future and democracy can\u2019t function in an ever \u2014 an ever-complex world. so, when i was elected and he called to congratulate me, i think to the surprise of the china experts who were \u2014 his people were on call as well as mine, listening \u2014 we had a two-hour conversation. for two hours. and we made several things clear to one another. i made it clear to him again what i\u2019ve told him in person on several occasions: that we\u2019re not looking for confrontation, although we know there will be steep, steep competition. two, that we\u2019ll have strong competition but we\u2019ll insist that china play by the international rules: fair competition, fair practices, fair trade. thirdly, in order to compete effectively, i indicated that we\u2019re going to deal with china effectively, and we\u2019re going to need three things to do that. i tell him, our people. first, we\u2019re going to invest in american workers and american science. i said that all through the campaign and i say it again. and we\u2019re \u2014 and i\u2019m setting up my administration to be able to do that, which is that, you know, back in the \u201860s, we used to invest a little over 2 percent of our entire gdp in pure research and investment in science. today, it\u2019s 0.7 percent. i\u2019m going to change that. we\u2019re going to change that. the future lies in who can, in fact, own the future as it relates to technology, quantum computing, a whole range of things, including in medical fields. and so what i\u2019m going to do is make sure we invest closer to 2 percent. one of the reasons why i\u2019ve set up the \u2014 the  pab  [pcast] \u2014 the president\u2019s board with scientists and the like, again \u2014 is we\u2019re going to invest in medical research \u2014 cancer, alzheimer\u2019s, diabetes, the things \u2014 industries of the future \u2014 artificial intelligence, quantum computing, biotech. and we\u2019re going to make real investments. china is out investing us by a longshot, because their plan is to own that future. the third \u2014 the second thing we\u2019re going to do is we\u2019re going to reestablish our alliances. and i\u2019ve been very clear with him, it\u2019s not anti-chinese. and we\u2019ve talked about it. i want to make sure that, for example, later today, after this \u2014 as a matter of fact, shortly after this, which is fine; we\u2019ve been going close to an hour. i\u2019m happy to go longer. but one of the things that i\u2019m going to be doing, i\u2019m going to be speaking with the 27 heads of state in europe and very shortly \u2014 i think within the next hour or so. i don\u2019t know the exact time. and earlier this month \u2014 and apparently it got the chinese\u2019s attention; that\u2019s not why i did it \u2014 i met with our allies and how we\u2019re going to hold china accountable in the region: australia, india, japan, and the united states \u2014 the so-called quad. because we have to have democracies working together. before too long, i\u2019m going to have \u2014 i\u2019m going to invite an alliance of democracies to come here to discuss the future. and so we\u2019re going to make it clear that in order to deal with these things, we are going to hold china accountable to follow the rules \u2014 to follow the rules \u2014 whether it relates to the south china sea or the north china sea, or their agreement made on taiwan, or a whole range of other things. and the third thing, and the thing that i admire about dealing with xi is he understands \u2014 he makes no pretense about not understanding what i\u2019m saying any more than i do him \u2014 i pointed out to him: no leader can be sustained in his position or her position unless they represent the values of the country. and i said as \u2014 \u201cand, mr. president, as i\u2019ve told you before, americans value the notion of freedom. america values human rights. we don\u2019t always live up to our expectations, but it\u2019s a values system. we are founded on that principle. and as long as you and your country continues to so blatantly violate human rights, we\u2019re going to continue, in an unrelenting way, to call to the attention of the world and make it clear \u2014 make it clear what\u2019s happening.\u201d and he understood that. i made it clear that no american president \u2014 at least one did \u2014 but no american president ever back down from speaking out of what\u2019s happening to the uighurs, what\u2019s happening in hong kong, what\u2019s happening in-country. that\u2019s who we are. the moment a president walks away from that, as the last one did, is the moment we begin to lose our legitimacy around the world. it\u2019s who we are. so i see stiff competition with china. china has an overall goal, and i don\u2019t criticize them for the goal, but they have an overall goal to become the leading country in the world, the wealthiest country in the world, and the most powerful country in the world. that\u2019s not going to happen on my watch because the united states are going to continue to grow and expand. q\u00a0 all right. just to follow up on the meeting of democracies: is that where you expect, in a multilateral way, to make these decisions about sanctions? or \u2014 the president: no, that\u2019s not where i make the decision; that\u2019s where i make sure we\u2019re all on the same page. all on the same page. look, i predict to you, your children or grandchildren are going to be doing their doctoral thesis on the issue of who succeeded: autocracy or democracy? because that is what is at stake, not just with china. look around the world. we\u2019re in the midst of a fourth industrial revolution of enormous consequence. will there be middle class? how will people adjust to these significant changes in science and technology and the environment? how will they do that? and are democracies equipped \u2014 because all the people get to speak \u2014 to compete? it is clear, absolutely clear \u2014 and most of the scholars i dealt with at penn agree with me around the country \u2014 that this is a battle between the utility of democracies in the 21st century and autocracies. if you notice, you don\u2019t have russia talking about communism anymore. it\u2019s about an autocracy. demand decisions made by a leader of a country \u2014 that\u2019s what\u2019s at stake here. we\u2019ve got to prove democracy works. q\u00a0 and, mr. president, sorry, i know you haven\u2019t had a chance to address the tragedies in georgia and colorado. you had said to stay tuned for actions that you might take on gun control. wondering if you\u2019ve made a decision either about sending the manufacturer liability bill that you had promised on day one to capitol hill, or executive actions like going after ghost guns or giving money to cities and states to battle gun control. the president: all the above. it\u2019s a matter of timing. as you\u2019ve all observed, successful presidents \u2014 better than me \u2014 have been successful, in large part, because they know how to time what they\u2019re doing \u2014 order it, decide and prioritize what needs to be done. the next major initiative is \u2014 and i\u2019ll be announcing it friday in pittsburgh, in detail \u2014 is to rebuild the infrastructure \u2014 both physical and technological infrastructure in this country \u2014 so that we can compete and create significant numbers of really good-paying jobs. really good-paying jobs. and some of you have been around long enough to know that used to be a great republican goal and initiative. i still think the majority of the american people don\u2019t like the fact that we are now ranked, what, 85th in the world in infrastructure. i mean, look, the future rests on whether or not we have the best airports that are going to accommodate air travel, ports that you can get in and out of quickly, so businesses decide. some of you, if you were ever local reporters, and you found your governor or mayor trying to attract business to your community, what\u2019s the first thing that businesses asked? \u201cwhat\u2019s the closest access to \u2014 access to an interstate highway? how far am i from a freight rail? is the water \u2014 is the water available? is there enough water available for me to conduct my business?\u201d all the things that relate to infrastructure. we have somewhere \u2014 i asked the staff to write it down for me, and they did \u2014 not for this, but for a longer discussion. we have somewhere, in terms of infrastructure \u2014 we have \u2014 we rank 13th globally in infrastructure. china is investing three times more in infrastructure than the united states is. bridges: more than one third of our bridges \u2014 231,000 of them \u2014 need repairs. some are physical safety risks or preservation work. one in five miles of our highways and major roads are in poor condition. that\u2019s 186,000 miles of highway. aviation: 20 percent of all flights \u2014 20 percent of all flights weren\u2019t on time, resulting in 1.5 million hours lost in production. six to ten million homes in america still have lead pipes servicing their water lines. we have over 100,000 wellheads that are not capped, leaking methane. what are we doing? and, by the way, we can put as many pipefitters and miners and \u2014 to work capping those wells at the same price that they would charge to dig those wells. so, i \u2014 i just find it frustrated \u2014 frustrating to talk about. last point i\u2019ll make on the infrastructure \u2014 and i apologize for spending more time on it, but \u2014 is that if you think about it, it\u2019s the place where we will be able to significantly increase american productivity, at the same time providing really good jobs for people. but we can\u2019t build back to what they used to be. we have to build \u2014 the environment has \u2014 global warming has already done significant damage. the roads that used to be above the water level \u2014 didn\u2019t have to worry about where the drainage ditch was \u2014 now you got to rebuild them three feet higher. because it\u2019s not going to go back to what it was before; it will only get worse, unless we stop it. there\u2019s so much we can do. look at all of the schools in america. most of you live in the washington area now. but in your hometowns \u2014 i don\u2019t know where you\u2019re all from \u2014 how many schools where the kids can\u2019t drink the water out of the fountain? how many schools are still in the position where there\u2019s asbestos? how many schools in america we\u2019re sending our kids to don\u2019t have adequate ventilation? how many homes, buildings, office complexes are wasting billions of barrels of oil over time because they can\u2019t hold in the heat or the air conditioning because it leaks through the windows that are so porous and the connections? it\u2019s amazing. so there\u2019s so much we can do that\u2019s good stuff, makes people healthier, and creates good jobs. and i think that i got one more question here. janet from univision. q\u00a0 thank you, mr. president. we, too, have been reporting at the border. and just like cecilia, we ran into a pair of siblings who came in on monday, who were detained by cbp \u2014 had the phone number for their mother who lives in the u.s. \u00a0we have contacted the mother. that\u2019s the only way they know her kids are here because cbp, today, thursday, has not contacted that mother. so when can we expect your promise of things getting better with contacting and expediency and processing? the president: well, they\u2019re already getting better, but they\u2019re going to get real \u2014 they\u2019ll get a whole hell of lot better real quick, or we\u2019re going to hear of some people leaving, okay? we can get this done. we\u2019re going to get it done. i had a long meeting with the entire team and several cabinet-level officers the other night. we\u2019re going to be moving, within the next \u2014 within the next week, over 100,000 \u2014 i mean, 1,000 people out of the border patrol into safe, secure beds and facilities. we\u2019re going to significantly ramp up. we\u2019re already out there contacting everyone, from getting some of the employees at hhs \u2014 and there\u2019s a lot of them doing other things \u2014 and move them into making those calls. we\u2019re in a \u2014 we\u2019re in the process of rearranging and providing for the personnel needed to get that done. but i admire the fact that you were down there; you\u2019re making the calls yourself. it\u2019s real. the next thing that has to happen though \u2014 as you well know has to happen \u2014 there have to be some certitude that this is the \u2014 actually mom, dad, or whomever. and there\u2019s ways to do that. there\u2019s ways to do that \u2014 a little bit like determining whether or not you got the right code for your credit card, you know? \u201cwhat was your dog\u2019s name?\u201d kind of a thing. i\u2019m being a bit facetious, but not really. and also seeking harder data, from dna to \u2014 to birth certificates, which takes longer.\u00a0 so, i want to do this as quickly as humanly possible and as safely as possible. q\u00a0 as you well know, treating the root cau- \u2014 causes in latin america doesn\u2019t change things overnight. how do you realistically and physically keep these families from coming to the u.s. when things will not get better in their countries right away? the president: well, i can\u2019t guarantee that. but i know, you know, that old thing: the journey of 1,000 miles starts with the first step. you know as well as i do; you cover it: you have serious \u2014 it\u2019s not like somebody at a sitting hand-hewn table in guatemala \u2014 i mean, in \u2014 in somewhere in mexico or in guadalupe, saying, \u201ci got a great idea. let\u2019s sell everything we have. give it to a coyote. have him take our kids across the border and into a desert where they don\u2019t speak the language. won\u2019t that be fun? let\u2019s go.\u201d that\u2019s not how it happens. people don\u2019t want to leave. when my great grandfather got on a coffin ship in the irish sea, expectation was: was he going to live long enough on that ship to get to the united states of america? but they left because of what the brits had been doing. they were in real, real trouble. they didn\u2019t want to leave. but they had no choice. so you got \u2014 we can\u2019t \u2014 i can\u2019t guarantee we\u2019re going to solve everything, but i can guarantee we can make everything better. we can make it better. we can change the lives of so many people. and the other thing i want to point out to you and i hope you point out: i realize it\u2019s much more heart wrenching \u2014 and it is \u2014 to deal with a five- and six- and seven-year-old. but you went down there, and you saw: the vast majority of these children \u2014 70 percent \u2014 are 16 years old, 17 years old, and mostly males. doesn\u2019t make it \u2014 that doesn\u2019t make it good, bad, or indifferent. but the idea that we have tens of thousands of kids in these god-awful facilities that are, really, little babies crying all night \u2014 and there\u2019s some; that\u2019s true. that\u2019s why we got to act. and yesterday, i asked my team \u2014 both the director of the two agencies, as well as others \u2014 i asked them what would they, in fact \u2014 and i asked their opinion because they\u2019re the experts \u2014 but i said, \u201cfocus on the most vulnerable immediately.\u201d but there\u2019s no reason why, in the next month, as people cross the border, that phone call can\u2019t be made in the first 48 hours and begin. q\u00a0 if i may ask one last question: have you had any talks with senate republicans who are threatening this administration with not considering the immigration legislation that was passed in the house until the situation at the border has been resolved? the president: no, because i know they have to posture for a while. they sort of got to get it out of their system. this is a \u2014 but i\u2019m ready to work with any republican who wants to help solve the problem and make the situation better. but, folks, i\u2019m going. thank you very, very much. i appreciate it. thank you.

24, 2021\t\t\t\t\t\t", "date": "march 24, 2021", "text": "james s. brady press briefing room 12:33 p.m. edt \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 as you may know and now you will know, today is equal pay day.\u00a0 and we have two special guests from the council of economic advisers: chair cecilia rouse and member heather boushey. \u00a0 chair cecilia rouse recently served as the dean of the princeton school of public and international affairs.\u00a0 she is a renowned labor economist with expertise centered in the economics of education and equality.\u00a0 cecilia previously served as a member of the council of economic advisers in the obama-biden administration and on the national economic council in the clinton administration.\u00a0 she is the first african american and just the fourth woman to lead the cea in the last 74 years of its existence. \u00a0 heather is a longtime economic counselor to president biden and previously served as president and ceo of the washington center for equitable growth.\u00a0 an expert on the impact of structural inequities on economic growth, she served as the chief economist for secretary of state hillary clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential transition team, and as an economist for a range of think tanks and the congressional joint economic committee. \u00a0 they both have quite some resumes.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to turn it over to them.\u00a0 they will each make some brief remarks, and we\u2019ll be able to take a couple of questions.\u00a0 and they actually have a meeting with the vice president they\u2019ll have to get to shortly thereafter. \u00a0 so, with that, i will turn it over. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 good afternoon.\u00a0 it\u2019s actually \u2014 it\u2019s a \u2014 it\u2019s a pleasure to be here today.\u00a0 so today is equal pay day \u2014 a day that is sym- \u2014 is a symbolic representation of how far into this year women must wor- \u2014 work to catch up to what men made in the previous year.\u00a0 \u00a0 women working fulltime, year round, are typically paid just 82 cents for every dollar paid to men.\u00a0 it\u2019s a reminder of the work that remains to be done to advance equity and ensure that all americans have the opportunity to reach their full potential.\u00a0 \u00a0 because of this gender gap, women lose thousands of dollars each year and hundreds of thousands of dollars over a lifetime.\u00a0 the disparities are greater for black and hispanic women who earn 63 cents and 55 cents for every dollar that a white man earns.\u00a0 \u00a0 what does this mean?\u00a0 so a black woman must work around 19 months to earn what a white man would earn in one year.\u00a0 for a hispanic woman, that is almost 22 months.\u00a0 \u00a0 so what does this really mean?\u00a0 it means i shouldn\u2019t be standing here today in front of you, and, really, i should be here sometime in august.\u00a0 \u00a0 so what are we doing about it?\u00a0 president biden and vice president harris believe we must begin by passing the paycheck fairness act.\u00a0 this bill would be an important step towards ending pay discrimination through transparency and accountability for employers.\u00a0 \u00a0 they believe we must provide paid family and medical leave, make childcare more affordable, and build pipelines for training that enable women to access higher-paying jobs.\u00a0 \u00a0 they\u2019re also committed to raising pay for childcare workers, preschool teachers, home health aides, and others in the care economy; and taking additional steps to increase wages for american workers, such as raising the minimum wage and empowering workers to organize and collectively bargain, both of which are important to reducing the wage gap for women.\u00a0 \u00a0 we have made progress.\u00a0 my daughter is here today; she\u2019s downstairs.\u00a0 and when i was her age, the gender wage gap was about 60 percent, compared to 80 percent \u2014 82 percent today.\u00a0 that said, there\u2019s still a lot of work to do.\u00a0 the biden-harris administration is working to make sure our daughters have the same opportunities that our sons do, and to make sure that every american is given a fair shot to get ahead in this country.\u00a0 \u00a0 these aren\u2019t simply women\u2019s issues.\u00a0 they affect all families, the ability of our economy to recover, and our nation\u2019s competitiveness.\u00a0 \u00a0 with that, i\u2019ll turn it over to heather.\u00a0 \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 thank you, cecilia.\u00a0 so the pandemic and the economic crisis have undermined the health and wellbeing of women and children in the united states.\u00a0 there are now 4.2 million fewer women working than there were in february of 2020, in large part because of the pandemic.\u00a0 millions more women have had to reduce their hours, often because taking care of the children is a responsibility that continues to fall disproportionately on women. \u00a0 our economic recovery depends on us addressing the barriers that have hampered women from fully participating in the labor force.\u00a0 \u00a0 so here\u2019s the good news: the american rescue plan will change the course of the pandemic and deliver immediate relief and support to women, families, and their communities critical to building a more equitable economy.\u00a0 \u00a0 the plan will increase the child tax credit from $2,000 per child to about $3,000 per child, and even more for a child under the age of six.\u00a0 this means a typical family of four with two young children will receive an additional $3,200 in assistance to cover the costs associated with raising children.\u00a0 this will benefit 66 million children.\u00a0 \u00a0 the plan will also increase the earned income tax credit for 17 million workers by as much as $1,000, benefiting many cashiers, food preparers and servers, and home health aides \u2014 those frontline workers who have helped their communities get through this crisis, many of them are women, many of whom are women of color.\u00a0 \u00a0 the plan also expands childcare assistance, helping hard- \u2014 hard-hit childcare providers, who are disproportionately women of color, cover their costs.\u00a0 and it will give families an additional tax credit to help them cut their childcare costs.\u00a0 families will get back, as a refundable tax credit, as much as half \u2014 half \u2014 of their spending on childcare for children under age 13.\u00a0 so they can receive a total of up to $4,000 for one child or up to $8,000 for two or more children.\u00a0 \u00a0 if we add it all up, these are historic actions that will not only help rescue our economy, they will help support our country\u2019s women and their families.\u00a0 but we know, as cecilia pointed out, we have to do more to close the wage gap and to take steps to ensure that all women, especially women of color, have their shot to get ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 and so, with that, we will take some questions.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 jennifer, kick us off. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 all right, thanks.\u00a0 a question for you both \u2014 this is on racial economic gaps.\u00a0 during the campaign, president biden talked about wanting the federal reserve to close income gaps and he wanted to measure the progress they make in closing those racial economic gaps.\u00a0 would you be willing to say if any steps have been taken so far towards requiring that sort of thing?\u00a0 is the white house still interested in talking to congress about amending the fed act to require some sort of measures? \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 sure, i\u2019m happy to take that.\u00a0 so, i can\u2019t speak to that exactly at this time.\u00a0 what i can say is that we are \u2014 this administration, across the administration \u2014 we are committed to addressing racial \u2014 the racial wage gaps and racial inequity gaps. \u00a0 i can say, at the cea, for example, we are using data to understand the impact of all of our policies when we study what\u2019s happening in the economy.\u00a0 we want to look at how it\u2019s not just affecting the average, but looking at all groups.\u00a0 \u00a0 and i would also mention that when chairman powell testified last \u2014 yesterday \u2014 i think it was just yesterday \u2014 and last week, he pointed to the fact that, as the federal reserve is doing its monetary policy, it is looking not just for the average unemployment rate to change; he is looking to see that the economy is doing well for everybody.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, you know, we are \u2014 we are very aligned on that. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks for doing this.\u00a0 josh boak with ap.\u00a0 lots of americans thought educational attainment would close the gender wage gap and racial inequality.\u00a0 but, in fact, if you look at college grads, the gap widens between men and women.\u00a0 some of that is due to age, but what are the factors driving here?\u00a0 why hasn\u2019t educational attainment delivered more? \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 i\u2019m happy to.\u00a0 yeah, so, you know, educational attainment was actually very instrumental in making some of the gains between my daughter \u2014 for, you know, the wage gap when i was coming up and my daughter. \u00a0 so we know that women getting hired \u2014 years of schooling was very important in the early years.\u00a0 but now we know that women, on average, are getting more schooling than men.\u00a0 so that is why it is not contributing as much.\u00a0 and what we see then is that there are other factors.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we see that the wage gap among young adults is actually fairly small.\u00a0 and it opens up particularly when women start families, which is why the care economy and the efforts we\u2019re making to ensure that workers \u2014 not just women, but all workers \u2014 can balance work and family is going to be so important.\u00a0 \u00a0 we also know that flexible workplaces is very important for helping workers to balance work/life \u2014 you know, the work responsibilities and job responsibilities.\u00a0 claudia goldin at harvard, for example, has found that the wage gap is smaller in occupations such as pharmacists where there\u2019s just more flexibility baked into the occupation.\u00a0 \u00a0 so there\u2019s still more work to be done.\u00a0 and i think it really goes to helping women in particular, but all workers balance responsibilities of family and work.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 karen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 heather, you had cited the statistics on 4.2 million fewer women now in the workforce than before covid.\u00a0 the president has said that women dropping out of the workforce during the pandemic is a \u201cnational emergency.\u201d\u00a0 are there new measures under discussion now, specifically on that issue, to reintroduce women back into the workforce \u2014 part of the build back better plan?\u00a0 and what can be done to bring them back in? \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 you know, i mean, the most important thing that we need to do is wrap our heads around this pandemic.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 \u00a0 so the steps that were taken as a part of the american rescue plan to, you know, deal with the health crisis, make sure that the vaccine gets out \u2014 all of those things \u2014 that is certainly going to be an important step forward so that schools can reopen safely. \u00a0 and then, of course, there are funds, as a part of the american rescue plan \u2014 historic investment in childcare centers to help them reopen safely.\u00a0 so part of what we see in this decline in women\u2019s employment is because of their \u2014 the fact that they\u2019re responsible for children; the fact that childcare centers have closed, schools aren\u2019t open, families are trying to telecommute, or they\u2019re trying to go out to their job and cope with children not having adequate care or the right care.\u00a0 that is really, i think, going to play an important role in getting folks back into the labor force. \u00a0 and i want to stress that\u2019s on both sides, right?\u00a0 in those caring economy parts of our economy, these are jobs that are disproportionately held by women.\u00a0 so, in making sure that schools are open and childcare centers are open, we\u2019re helping those women as workers and also as parents and caregivers.\u00a0 so i think that is \u2014 those are some of the first steps that we need to see.\u00a0 \u00a0 but, you know, over time, making sure that, as \u2014 you know, as cecilia said, making sure that we have that strong foundation in the care economy on issues around childcare, also issues around, you know, how we help families that have someone who needs some extra care or, sort of, later-in-life issues \u2014 the aging and the disabled \u2014 along with making sure that we have workplace flexibility and we have paid leave.\u00a0 these are all things that help make it possible for people who have care responsibilities to be full members of our economy and our society.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 andrea and weijia, and then we got to \u2014 we got to wrap it up.\u00a0 sorry.\u00a0 it\u2019s equal pay day.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just real quickly, in terms of the infrastructure package that\u2019s coming next \u2014 right? \u2014 so that we\u2019re talking about quite a lot of money: two to three trillion dollars.\u00a0 what specific things do you think essentially have to be part of that?\u00a0 and what role in all of this does the \u2014 sort of, your push for the federal minimum wage increase play?\u00a0 and how do you convince congress that that\u2019s an essential part?\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 well, i can take a stab at that. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 do you want to \u2014 yeah.\u00a0 \u00a0 dr. boushey:\u00a0 so, you know, we know that the president has been so clear throughout the campaign and into governing on what his values are and where he wants to guide this economy.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 that we\u2019re focused on how we can deepen, strengthen, broaden the middle class.\u00a0 \u00a0 that\u2019s why we\u2019re so focused on equal pay day because we know that women are a key part of \u2014 you know, make up the workers that make up the middle class.\u00a0 and he\u2019s been very clear in his support of raising the minimum wage to $15 an hour.\u00a0 that these are the kinds of focus that we need to have in \u2014 as the agenda is built out, this is what he\u2019s asked us to focus on.\u00a0 \u00a0 alongside this, we need to make sure that we are making sure that the economy is directed at enhancing, supporting, building american competitiveness so that we\u2019re creating those good jobs and they\u2019re available for all people \u2014 not just some people, but people all across these united states. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 yeah, i guess what i was just going to add to that is that \u2014 right? \u2014 this next package is really about investing in our future and in making the kinds of smart investments that we know will increase growth.\u00a0 and we want that growth to be widely shared.\u00a0 so the idea is not just to increase the size of the pie, but to ensure that everybody gets their slice, unlike many policies that had been followed in the past. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do you need to \u2014 i\u2019m sorry, do you need to like include some kind of private-sector initiatives to nudge those companies that aren\u2019t moving along as quickly? \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 look, i \u2014 we really can\u2019t speak to the specifics.\u00a0 i think you\u2019re used to jen saying she likes to keep her job.\u00a0 i\u2019d kind of like to keep mine, too.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 so we are \u2014 you know, we are looking at the most effective ways in order to meet these kinds of investments that we know are just so important to work on. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you so much.\u00a0 i think, just to follow up on karen\u2019s question: you know, making sure that there is support for the women is one thing, but will there be any concrete measures in the build back better plan to make sure the 4.2 million women have jobs to return to? \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 right.\u00a0 that is the exact purpose of the american rescue plan, right?\u00a0 the whole purpose is to get us through this pandemic with \u2014 and to help our businesses that are viable stay in business, to help the workers who need help paying their rent and getting food on the table to stay engaged and not just imagine that they\u2019re going to drop out and drop out forever.\u00a0 \u00a0 we know that the longer that we have the economic crisis and the longer that workers are out of the workforce, the harder it is for them to come back.\u00a0 so that is the entire focus of the american rescue plan \u2014 is to get us back on track so that by next year we are back to essentially full employment.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 thank you both so much for coming.\u00a0 \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 thank you. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 we\u2019d love to have you back. \u00a0 chair rouse:\u00a0 thank you. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay, i just have a couple of other items for you all at the top.\u00a0 \u00a0 as you know, this afternoon, the president and first lady will be joined by megan rapinoe and margaret purce at the white house for a virtual event with other members of the u.s. women\u2019s national team where the president will sign a proclamation marking equal pay day.\u00a0 \u00a0 additionally, the second gentleman is in st. louis, missouri, for a listening session on gender equity in the workforce. \u00a0 as cecilia and heather just detailed, the pandemic and economic crisis have undermined the health and wellbeing of women and children.\u00a0 the american rescue plan provides help for women and families by increasing the child tax credit, expanding childcare assistance, and providing women and families the relief they need.\u00a0 it also provides $130 billion to help schools serve all students and reopen. \u00a0 yesterday, on the anniversary of the affordable care act being signed into law, the president, of course, traveled to ohio \u2014 it was a great trip \u2014 where he announced that the administration would expand access to healthcare coverage by extending the special enrollment period until august 15th.\u00a0 i know a number of you noted that, but i just wanted to reiterate it since it was late in the day.\u00a0 \u00a0 this morning, the president was proud to sign into law the save lives act.\u00a0 the bipartisan piece of legislation will give the va the ability to provide vaccines to all veterans and boost vaccine efforts for veteran\u2019s families and caregivers.\u00a0 it\u2019s truly a testament to what government can do when we work together.\u00a0 he\u2019s grateful for the leadership of both the senate and house veterans\u2019 affairs committee: both chairs mark takano and jon tester, and ranking members mike bost and jerry moran. \u00a0 as we announced this morning \u2014 but to give you a little bit more detail \u2014 the president will travel to pittsburgh, pennsylvania, next week on wednesday, march 31st, where he will deliver a speech laying out more details of his plan to build the economy back better.\u00a0 \u00a0 over the next several days \u2014 and this is probably why they were hesitant to give more detail \u2014 he will continue meeting with his economic team to finalize details of his proposal, including the scale, scope, and final policy components.\u00a0 his focus, of course, will be on investing in america\u2019s workers, making sure the tax code rewards worth not wealth, delivering on the promises he made to the american people when he was running for president. \u00a0 with that, go ahead, josh. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 on the shooting in colorado, the president said, \u201ccongress must act.\u201d\u00a0 senator \u2014 senate majority leader schumer has also said the senate is poised to act.\u00a0 but vice president harris said today, on cbs, that she thought the change would have occurred after the sandy hook shootings.\u00a0 \u00a0 and i\u2019m curious: what does the president think is different this time?\u00a0 and how has he changed his approach so that this administration can pass these changes, when, in the past, it failed? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, first, the president shares that sentiment, as i think many americans do, that when we saw 20 children murdered, when we saw 6 adults murdered, that that would turn the tide of congress. \u00a0 we have seen data and statistics still \u2014 across the country \u2014 still broadly support background checks.\u00a0 i think it\u2019s about 80 percent of the american public support background checks, including a good percentage of gun owners support background checks.\u00a0 \u00a0 we\u2019ve seen states take action.\u00a0 since that time, a number of states across the country have put in place a number of laws.\u00a0 sometimes states are the leaders, as we know and we\u2019ve seen in other areas of policymaking.\u00a0 \u00a0 but i think the president, who has been in public life and public office for 50 years \u2014 more than 50 years \u2014 would be the first to tell you, if he were standing here, that just because you don\u2019t get the policymaking and the legislation done the first time, it doesn\u2019t mean you quit trying.\u00a0 \u00a0 and certainly, tragedies like we saw earlier this week, like we saw last week \u2014 mass shootings that are killing innocent lives, leaving family members without their loved ones \u2014 is a reminder of how important and vital that is.\u00a0 \u00a0 he has talked about, as he did yesterday, the importance of working with congress.\u00a0 i know the vice president touched on the fact that if we want something to be permanent, if we want it to be lasting, we need it to be legislation.\u00a0 he certainly believes that, but there are also executive actions under consideration that we will continue working through internally.\u00a0 and there\u2019s lots of levers you can take, obviously, as president and vice president. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, secondly, today is the first chance for many in the media to see the situation on the southern border at government facilities. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 this is the first step of transparency.\u00a0 what else can we expect with regard to that so we can evaluate the situation and present it to the public? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well first, as you noted \u2014 i know all of you have covered this, but just to kind of reiterate where we are here: so there\u2019s a delegation of members of congress and white house officials who are traveling to the office of refugee resettlement at carrizo springs in the \u2014 at the influx care facility there.\u00a0 there is a network pool camera that will be a part of this journey, which will be \u2014 which will ensure that there\u2019s network pool coverage \u2014 or network pool footage, i should say, that is provided to all of the networks so that you can all see, as the media, for yourselves and be able to provide analysis on that b-roll footage. \u00a0 and we are also \u2014 remain committed to transparency and will continue to work with agencies on creating avenues for media access to \u2014 and visibility into these facilities.\u00a0 \u00a0 so i think our balance is, of course, privacy; as you all know, it is also that we are in the middle of a pandemic; and that, you know, these facilities, of course, can\u2019t become forums for media access all day long every day.\u00a0 i think we all agree on that balance.\u00a0 but we will continue to look for ways to increase transparency and provide additional access and fulfill requests. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 a couple questions on guns and \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki: \u00a0sure. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 then aapi representation.\u00a0 and at what point would president biden consider taking executive action instead of waiting for congress to wait?\u00a0 in other words, how many measures would have to fail before he stepped in? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think he sees it as vital to take steps on two tracks because congressional legislation, as the vice president conveyed this morning, obviously has a more permanent, lasting impact.\u00a0 executive actions are, of course, an important lever that every president has at their disposal.\u00a0 \u00a0 there\u2019s current discussions and analysis internally of what steps can be taken \u2014 and that \u2014 that has been ongoing for several weeks, even before these two recent tragedies \u2014 that, you know, he looks forward to getting an update on and seeing what can be moved forward on that front as well. \u00a0 so he\u2019s not waiting for anything to fail is really the answer to your question. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what executive actions do you think he\u2019s most likely to take? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 i have it, myself, as well.\u00a0 but it\u2019s an ongoing policy process internally.\u00a0 i will say that his view, the vice president\u2019s view, and our policy team\u2019s view is that it\u2019s not just about addressing gun access.\u00a0 that\u2019s important and obviously there\u2019s legislation that\u2019s under consideration on background checks that they both strongly support, they want to see move forward.\u00a0 it\u2019s also about addressing community violence and, you know, a range of issues that are root causes and kind of lead to the \u2014 the deaths and the impact that we\u2019re seeing that\u2019s so troubling.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 got it.\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 and then, on the other issue: you know, the white house had conversations with senators duckworth and hirono.\u00a0 i think one concern that they have brought is the question of who is advising president biden from the aapi community as we see this surge of violence.\u00a0 i know ambassador rice and cedric richmond are leading the engagement efforts.\u00a0 who in the aapi community is having direct conversations with the president about what\u2019s unfolding? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, you mentioned cedric and susan rice, who have been doing listening sessions for some time, and obviously those will continue to pick up.\u00a0 obviously, the vice president, who is the first in the meeting and the last in a meeting on every issue, including the impact of the violence and the threats and the \u2014 that we\u2019ve seen increase over the past several months against the aapi community \u2014 as a member herself of the aapi community, is certainly playing an important role on that.\u00a0 \u00a0 and as we noted in a statement we released last night, we are also adding a senior-level asian american/pacific islander liaison who will ensure the community\u2019s voice is further represented and heard \u2014 not just around crises, not just around an increase in violence, but in general, and, you know, playing an important role with a seat at the table. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and, to be clear, this is a new position in addition to the one over in public engagement?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 this is the one that we announced last night.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 so it\u2019s going to be a new senior-level position? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes, (inaudible).\u00a0 yep.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 will this this person also have a policy portfolio, or will it just be mainly outreach? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i can get you more specifics.\u00a0 i mean, i think that when they\u2019re \u2014 all the roles that are in our liaison \u2014 playing liaison roles typically have a seat at the table on a range of issues, so whether it is healthcare or climate or community violence.\u00a0 so, typically, it\u2019s having a seat at the table on a range of topics, but i can see if there\u2019s more specifics.\u00a0 obviously, we have not hired yet because we just announced this last night. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to follow up on the discussion: the president \u2014 you were talking yesterday about executive action on gun reform.\u00a0 the president also was making it clear he wanted to see congress act. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 he said that several times. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 would he propose his own gun reform plan that he would present to congress, as we\u2019ve seen them do with the covid relief plan and what we anticipate coming on the economic plan?\u00a0 would this be something that could originate here and not wait for congress to move? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 you know, karen, i think it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 there\u2019s obviously a lot of pieces of legislation that have been proposed.\u00a0 there\u2019s these two background check bills that are \u2014 have moved their way through the house.\u00a0 there\u2019s also legislation that\u2019s been proposed by senator feinstein, congressman cicilline that addresses some banning \u2014 an assault weapons ban, which is something the president worked to pass in the \u201890s when he was in the senate.\u00a0 \u00a0 so there\u2019s a range of steps that can be taken to increase gun safety measures.\u00a0 what our team is looking at now is: what is the legislation that\u2019s out there?\u00a0 are there any gaps that need to be filled; policies or proposals that have been introduced in the past that could be reintroduced?\u00a0 \u00a0 so i don\u2019t have anything to predict for you on whether there\u2019d be something independent.\u00a0 i think we\u2019re looking at what a number of passionate gun safety advocates on the hill have already introduced to see where we can help push the boulder on that.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 has the president spoken with any of the families of the colorado shooting \u2014 any of the victims\u2019 families?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any calls to read out for you.\u00a0 you know, he is somebody who obviously has a deep connection to loss, and we don\u2019t always read out those calls.\u00a0 i can check and see if there\u2019s anything that has \u2014 that he has done that he\u2019d be comfortable conveying to all of you.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and can i just do one more on the border? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 could you give us an update on progress from the family reunification task force?\u00a0 have there been families, children reunited back with their parents?\u00a0 where does that stand right now? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 there have been.\u00a0 and a lot of that has happened through lawyers and outside groups and the ngo community that plays an incredible role here.\u00a0 \u00a0 there will be an update provided at day 120 that will be more of an official report and update out of the department of homeland security.\u00a0 so, in advance of that, i\u2019m not sure we\u2019ll have incremental updates, but there have been some progress made, thanks in large part to the work of legal experts and ngos on the outside. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and the task force is working with those ngos? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 they\u2019re in touch with them as well, but we\u2019ll have our first formal update at day 120 and then, i believe, every 60 days thereafter. \u00a0 go ahead, jeff. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jen, why did the president wait until there was another shooting until he addressed gun violence in america?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 he actually addressed it.\u00a0 we put out a statement in his name on the anniversary of \u2014 in early february, the anniversary of the shooting in florida.\u00a0 so he has addressed it before and certainly has stressed it even as president and will continue to address it as president.\u00a0 \u00a0 and as you know, geoff, from covering him in congress for a long time, this has been a passion of his \u2014 putting in place gun safety measures \u2014 throughout his career.\u00a0 that\u2019s why he fought to get the brady bill passed, why he fought to ban assault weapons, why he was the lead in the obama-biden administration in putting in place more than a dozen executive actions to make it safer for our communities.\u00a0 and it\u2019s something that he will continue to work on as president. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 of course, he knows, though, that the president\u2019s bully pulpit is unparalleled, and yet it took him until more than 60 days into his presidency to talk about gun violence, on camera, in america.\u00a0 what does that say about his commitment or how much political capital he\u2019s willing to spend on this issue?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i first would say that anybody who has been following the tragedies and the shootings that have happened in our country over the past several years, if not decades, knows that this is an issue the president is deeply committed to, and his career is evidence of that.\u00a0 \u00a0 and i don\u2019t think anyone who\u2019s an advocate is looking at how many words he\u2019s spoken; they\u2019re looking at what his background has been, where he has fought the fights.\u00a0 and he has fought the fights on the brady bill, on the assault weapons ban, on getting legislation passed.\u00a0 it wasn\u2019t successful, as was alluded to earlier in a question.\u00a0 we know that.\u00a0 but this is something he\u2019s going to put his shoulder into; he\u2019s going to work with members of both parties; he\u2019s going to certainly advocate for it. \u00a0 and i think for those who have survived gun violence, for those who\u2019ve lost family members, they\u2019re really looking for action, and they\u2019re really looking at the record that he has or \u2014 he has over the course of the decades of his career. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if i could follow up on the question on the border: the access being granted today for the pool is of a facility that is aspirational of where you want to move these children.\u00a0 what about access to the facilities where there is overcrowding and there is an actual problem?\u00a0 why was this one chosen over those? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 we\u2019re also open to providing access there, and this is just the first step in the process of providing greater access to the media. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and when would that decision to be made?\u00a0 you said earlier this week that you would be working on access.\u00a0 is this the only access, or will that be coming in the coming days like the \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no, i would \u2014 i would consider it \u2014 it\u2019s ongoing, and we wanted to provide pool coverage, as you all know who are in the television \u2014 field of television that allows for video \u2014 a video camera to provide access to all the networks.\u00a0 we felt that would be a good first step, and we\u2019re looking forward to continuing to engage about how to provide increased access. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 would you agree, though, that you\u2019ve chosen the facility that is the aspirational facility, as opposed to the problem at this moment?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i would say we all agree that the border patrol facilities are not places where children should be.\u00a0 they are \u2014 children should be moving more quickly through those facilities.\u00a0 that is what our policy\u2019s central focus is right now, as you know, jeff.\u00a0 and there are also \u2014 it\u2019s also becoming a public health concern because of the number of kids who are moving through those facilities and the fact \u2014 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but why not show those?\u00a0 why not show those to the american people? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, we will, and we are working with the border patrol and with dhs to determine how we can do that.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead, jennifer. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on iraq and withdrawing u.s. troops from iraq, could you please give us an update on iraq\u2019s request for the start of talks on that withdrawal, please? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 that\u2019s something we are looking forward to convening next month.\u00a0 and i\u2019m not sure if i have an update, other than to convey that we look forward to our strategic dialogue with the government of iraq over the month of april.\u00a0 the meetings will further clarify that coalition forces are in iraq at the invitation of the iraqi government and solely for the purpose of training and advising iraqi forces to ensure that isis cannot reconstitute.\u00a0 \u00a0 and we are committed, first and foremost, to iraq sovereignty.\u00a0 we look forward to these important discussions with iraqi leaders on the future of our partnership that will convene next month. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i got a couple of quick ones for you.\u00a0 so, on nord stream 2 \u2014 that is an issue that keeps coming up in the relationship with germany \u2014 how soon do you think those sanctions will be implemented?\u00a0 and has the president had a chance to discuss this issue, at his level, with the chancellor of germany? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any calls, although we do read out the calls that he does.\u00a0 so you would certainly know if he had a call with the chancellor of germany, i can assure you.\u00a0 so not a new one that i\u2019m aware of that you are not aware of.\u00a0 \u00a0 we continue to believe it\u2019s a bad deal.\u00a0 i don\u2019t think we have an update on the po- \u2014 our policy position beyond that.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and then, 14 states have now sued the administration over the oil and gas \u2014 over the pause in oil and gas leasing.\u00a0 what do you say to that?\u00a0 and how do you move beyond that?\u00a0 i mean, how do you \u2014 how do you \u2014 you know, i realize there\u2019s a legal process, but how do you address \u2014 how you get your point across in this legal environment? \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 well, i would say, first, oil and gas jobs aren\u2019t going anywhere.\u00a0 the outgoing administration flooded the oil markets with cheap federal leases.\u00a0 this will not affect oil and gas production or jobs for years to come.\u00a0 \u00a0 and what president biden has pledged to do is invest to create jobs and ensure america leads the clean energy revolution, which is where the industry is largely going anyway, where there is the greatest opportunity for job creation.\u00a0 he wants to create good-paying union jobs.\u00a0 and that\u2019s something he believes and he\u2019s committed to doing.\u00a0 \u00a0 i think there\u2019s a lot of \u2014 there is some misinformation out there about what this means, which is why it\u2019s \u2014 not \u2014 and i\u2019m not saying from the media; i\u2019m just saying in general.\u00a0 and again, there are oil and gas jobs that are out there.\u00a0 the existing leases will continue.\u00a0 he\u2019s really talking about future leases. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and then just one more on the gun issue.\u00a0 i know this is kind of a crazy question, but \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s always a good lead-in when it\u2019s a crazy question.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 it\u2019s quite a lead-in. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 you know, given the history of people trying to enact gun control legislation in this country \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 is there some consideration to taking a look at the second amendment and just addressing it from a, sort of, this \u2014 the underlying constitutional right to bear arms?\u00a0 does that \u2014 is that something that the president feels needs to be called into question so many years after the revolution? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no one is talking about overturning or changing the second amendment.\u00a0 what our focus is on is putting in place commonsense measures that will make our communities safer, make families safer, make kids safer.\u00a0 the majority of the american public supports background checks.\u00a0 the majority of the american public does not believe that anyone needs to have an assault weapon.\u00a0 so that\u2019s really what our focus is on at this point in time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and, jen \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 oh. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 joe manchin is not in support of this.\u00a0 once again, you have a democrat, a member of the president\u2019s own party, who is already signaling that he will not support that.\u00a0 you have a very slim majority.\u00a0 can you convince republicans to support this legislation so that you can work around a democrat that\u2019s not supporting it? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 as the president said yesterday, we don\u2019t know yet; he hasn\u2019t done the vote count.\u00a0 \u00a0 but it is certainly an issue he will talk to members about and convey why he feels it\u2019s so important; that it\u2019s not a \u2014 shouldn\u2019t be a political issue; that keeping our community safe, family safe, looking at the track record as what has worked in states \u2014 which is very informative, and actually, to josh\u2019s earlier question, something that we know more about now than we may have 10 years ago.\u00a0 so he will be conveying that to members he\u2019s communicating with. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 two questions.\u00a0 following up on weijia\u2019s question about representation: the biden administration is the first in 20 years to not have an asian american lead one of the 15 executive departments in the cabinet.\u00a0 so how does the white house square that fact with the president\u2019s pledges to make this the most representative, most diverse in history? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i will just say the president remains committed to making sure this is the most diverse administration in history.\u00a0 that has always been \u2014 remains our goal.\u00a0 we\u2019ve made a lot of progress.\u00a0 we have the most diverse cabinet in history.\u00a0 we will continue to make progress.\u00a0 we have aapi staff at senior levels and at all levels of the administration, and we will continue to work to find ways to elevate aapi voices at the highest level of government.\u00a0 \u00a0 there are a number of cabinet level \u2014 i know it\u2019s not 15 members, so \u2014 but just to note, obviously, katherine tai, who received overwhelming support in the senate in her approval to be confirmed for ustr; julie su at the department of labor; kiran ahuja \u2014 i\u2019m going to butcher that name, and i apologize to kiran \u2014 at opm; todd kim, the assistant attorney general at doj.\u00a0 so we will continue \u2014 and obviously there are more positions and roles that we need to fill. \u00a0 and i will say, first and foremost, the president\u2019s view is that we need to listen, and that is an important component of how we\u2019re communicating with members of congress as concerns arise.\u00a0 also with leaders in the community, as he and the vice president did last friday \u2014 why it\u2019s so important, as we look to policymaking, to have senior members of our administration do listening sessions in the community to determine how we can best address needs.\u00a0 \u00a0 is it \u2014 there\u2019s personnel, of course, and we will continue to work toward that.\u00a0 there\u2019s policies.\u00a0 and that\u2019s part of our objective and our focus at this point in time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and also, a quick one on guns.\u00a0 the president also talked several times about a federal assault weapons ban, and i\u2019m wondering how he plans to build a coalition around that when \u2014 even when that policy is something that is opposed by many moderate democrats in congress. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, though, it is supported by the majority of the american people, and that is an important fact.\u00a0 and he will \u2014 it\u2019s something that he has long had a view and a belief: that no one needs an assault weapon, that it is not something that should be a part of what people have access to in this country.\u00a0 and he will continue to \u2014 \u00a0 so are you asking, kind of, who will he talk to?\u00a0 or who will he \u2014 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how does he plan to build the coalition in congress to build that support? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, part of it is certainly communicating with the advocates; it\u2019s communicating with outside groups, with gun owners, many of whom will tell you that they don\u2019t believe they would support an assault weapons ban; communicating with leaders in states where laws have been put in place that have been impactful; and, obviously, having conversations with members he\u2019s known for some time \u2014 having them at the staff level and determining if we can find a path forward. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 i\u2019d like to ask you two questions \u2014\u00a0the first about marijuana and the second about a bit of a historical mystery i\u2019m hoping you could help us solve. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 there\u2019s a lot of setups for these questions today.\u00a0 i like it.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 so vice president kamala harris says that she is a past marijuana smoker.\u00a0 she said, quote, \u201cit gives\u2026people joy.\u00a0 and we need more joy in this world.\u201d\u00a0 she is with a clear majority of the u.s. population in supporting marijuana legalization.\u00a0 according to polls, two thirds of people do, including about half of republicans.\u00a0 \u00a0 yet, last week, the daily beast reported that there were dozens of white house staffers who were either disciplined or terminated from their jobs for past marijuana use.\u00a0 you seem to confirm five terminations on twitter.\u00a0 \u00a0 and my question is: why would president biden allow this to happen, especially considering the white house staff were led to believe that pot use would not be disqualifying, especially considering the vice president is herself a former marijuana user? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, let me first say that what we tried to do as an administration was work with the security service who actually makes these determinations about suitability for serving in government.\u00a0 in the past \u2014 and i served in the obama-biden administration \u2014 the rules were actually far more stringent.\u00a0 so that isn\u2019t about anyone\u2019s personal point of view; it\u2019s about working through the process, the history, and modernizing it and taking steps to address the fact that marijuana is legal in a number of states across the country.\u00a0 it is still illegal federally.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 we know that.\u00a0 \u00a0 there were \u2014 as i noted, i think, in our comment last week \u2014 five individuals who are no longer employed at the white house.\u00a0 a number of them \u2014 there were other security issues that were raised, and, you know, that\u2019s an unfortunate conclusion, of course.\u00a0 \u00a0 but what we try to do is enable additional members of the team, who would not have been able to continue serving in past administrations, to continue serving by updating our policy in coordination with the security service.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just to follow up on that, surely president biden could, you know, implement changes here unilaterally and just say that these people can come to work for him.\u00a0 why \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i think if marijuana was federally legal, that might be a different circumstance.\u00a0 but i don\u2019t \u2014 i don\u2019t think i have any more for this on you \u2014 on this for you. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do you have any more data on the number of people impacted other than the five people who were terminated? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any more data for you, other than to convey that there were a number of people who would not have been able to serve in past administrations.\u00a0 and because of our efforts to modernize and work with the security service, they\u2019re able to serve. \u00a0 did you have another question? \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 yes, i do. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so this is a, as i set it up, a bit of a mystery.\u00a0 and i\u2019m sure that you\u2019ve inquired about this yourself and \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 oh, okay.\u00a0 where\u2019s the cat?\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no, no, it\u2019s not that. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so there was a report last year from the senate finance and homeland security committees.\u00a0 it claimed that the wife of moscow\u2019s former mayor paid a company associated with the president\u2019s son $3.5 million.\u00a0 there was no explanation for this alleged payments, and i\u2019m wondering if you could tell us if that claim is accurate, and if so, what the $3.5 million was paid for. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m not familiar with that claim.\u00a0 it doesn\u2019t sound like it\u2019s backed up by a lot of evidence.\u00a0 if you have evidence or specifics, i\u2019m happy to discuss it further. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (inaudible) the senate committee\u2019s report.\u00a0 so you haven\u2019t asked about this?\u00a0 or \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m not familiar with the report at all.\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 with the may 1st deadline looming, when can we expect to hear from the president about the timing on withdrawal from afghanistan? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s a good question.\u00a0 as you may know, secretary blinken is currently in brussels and talking with our nato european partners.\u00a0 he did a press avail \u2014 i believe it was yesterday.\u00a0 \u00a0 but let me reiterate a couple of the points he made, and then i\u2019ll get to your question: that our focus right now is to \u2014 is, for him, to share some of our thinking with our vital nato partners, consult with them, hear from them on where they see things going, where they want things to go; that, as the president had said last week, it\u2019s tough meeting that may 1st timeline, and the secretary of state reiterated that in his remarks as well.\u00a0 \u00a0 whatever we do will be informed by our allies and partners.\u00a0 but the president is currently discussing, of course, with policy team members on what is possible.\u00a0 and hopefully he\u2019ll have an update soon, but i don\u2019t have a timeline on that for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 do you expect any announcement this week? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i can\u2019t give you a timeline.\u00a0 it\u2019s really up to his own decision making and when he\u2019s prepared to talk about that publicly.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 i have a couple of foreign policy questions.\u00a0 i understand the administration has already supported covax, is working with the quad to ramp up production, working out details with mexico and canada.\u00a0 but where is the president\u2019s position on the request by more than 55 countries, as well as some democratic lawmakers, on making vaccine patent through the who \u2014 giving a waiver to that? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, the top priority of the president\u2019s and of the united states is saving lives and ending the pandemic in the united states and, of course, around the world.\u00a0 that includes investing in covax; working with partners, as we announced with the quad, to produce a billion vaccine doses to surge vaccine production and delivery.\u00a0 as part of rebuilding our alliances, we\u2019re exploring every avenue to coordinate with our global partners and are evaluating the efficacy of any measure by its true potential to save lives.\u00a0 \u00a0 so that\u2019s how we\u2019re looking at it through the prism.\u00a0 there are probably \u2014 there are a number of steps, a number of ways we are engaged in addressing the global pandemic through the global international community, and we\u2019ll look at a range of options.\u00a0 but i don\u2019t have any update for you on the patent question. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but just as a general principle, do you believe that protecting american innovation and intellectual property of pharmaceutical companies outweighs the benefit of moving faster towards a covid-free world? \u00a0 ms. psaki: \u00a0sure \u2014 i absolutely understand your question. what i\u2019m conveying is we look at every option through the prism of whether it will save lives and how many lives it will save, and try to put our resources and efforts into those that we think will be most effective.\u00a0 \u00a0 you know, obviously, part of that is through engagement with the who.\u00a0 i mentioned our quad partnership, our meaningful contribution to covax.\u00a0 and, of course, when we can, we will share vaccines \u2014 as we have already, as we are already doing with canada and mexico.\u00a0 but we\u2019re looking at a range of options.\u00a0 \u00a0 right now, our focus is on continuing to address the pandemic that is ongoing in the united states, given a thousand people are still dying every single day. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 another foreign policy question, please.\u00a0 so can you comment on media reports on whether the administration is considering joining a group of south american nations to push back against chinese illegal fishing?\u00a0 how big of a problem does the administration see this kind of chinese practice of distant-water fishing?\u00a0 and would this be something that you would consider with other regions, including southeast asia and africa? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 it is a challenge and a problem, and one that we\u2019re watching closely.\u00a0 and for others who have not been following this issue as closely, it is an issue of overfishing in certain parts of the world.\u00a0 it is something our national security team is certainly watching and following closely.\u00a0 i can see if there\u2019s more specifics on their engagements to update you on. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and one domestic question.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just a question on vaccination for federal government employees.\u00a0\u00a0 i mean, so far, it\u2019s been pretty much where they live, right?\u00a0 i mean, if you\u2019re in d.c., you follow d.c. rules \u2014 maryland, and so forth.\u00a0 is there any other kind of consideration from the white house to just expand access to vaccines for federal government employees? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it\u2019s a great question.\u00a0 i\u2019ll have to check with our covid team.\u00a0 obviously, everyone will be eligible in just over a month, including our government employees.\u00a0 and d.c. and virginia have already made that commitment \u2014 maybe maryland, too.\u00a0 i don\u2019t want to leave them out.\u00a0 so that is good news for every federal government employee.\u00a0 but i can check and see if there\u2019s more specifics across the administration about our approach. \u00a0 go ahead, in the back.\u00a0 and then, we\u2019ll go back. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a couple of questions.\u00a0 first, i wanted to ask about voting rights.\u00a0 the senate right now is debating its own version of the for the people act. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it\u2019s \u2014 there are a few hang-ups with it in the chamber.\u00a0 i was curious how much emphasis the president plans to put on this \u2014 if he will be reaching out directly, or if there\u2019s a team from the white house that\u2019s working on this issue. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes, i would say we\u2019re very engaged \u2014 closely engaged on s1 that is being negotiated, as you said.\u00a0 and there are changes being made \u2014 which we fully expected that there would be, as a number of senators, i believe, have alluded to that being a possibility and things they\u2019d like to see changed. so it\u2019s working its way through the process.\u00a0 we get regular updates \u2014 our legislative team does.\u00a0 and we remain very closely engaged. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and i wanted to ask: leader mcconnell has said that he hasn\u2019t been invited to the white house and he hasn\u2019t had a direct conversation with the president since the inauguration. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think he corrected that statement. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 i was curious because i know, previously, leader mccarthy had said that he had tried to reach out to the white house to get an invitation here.\u00a0 does the president plan to have some sort of big, you know, meeting with leaders from across the aisle where we would see photos of them together and things like that? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m sure he will.\u00a0 we obviously have been limited on covid to any events in the east wing.\u00a0 and at this point, we\u2019d be very much in the east- \u2014 the easter egg roll preparations, which, of course, we will not be \u2014 but obviously more important, substantive, vital meetings than that.\u00a0 \u00a0 he\u2019s had a number of meetings \u2014 bipartisan meetings in the oval office.\u00a0 he will continue to do those.\u00a0 those have often been constructed with committee chairs or members with specific jurisdiction.\u00a0 he has \u2014 he has a long friendship with leader mcconnell.\u00a0 he has spoken with him.\u00a0 he speaks with him regularly.\u00a0 we\u2019re obviously not going to read out all of those calls.\u00a0 and i expect that will continue. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and i wanted to ask: we\u2019ve been seeing a lot of images of spring breakers, especially in florida, and i was curious how aware of that the president \u2014 if he is being updated on that regularly and if he plans to make any sort of address or public appeal to people on the issue. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, we do watch that closely.\u00a0 the president is briefed regularly by his covid team, and, of course, he has seen the news coverage \u2014 thanks to all of you \u2014 of spring breakers who have been gathering in far too many numbers.\u00a0 there, of course, were steps taken locally in response to this.\u00a0 we also watch that closely.\u00a0 \u00a0 you know, i\u2019m not sure i\u2019d \u2014 i don\u2019t have anything to preview for you in terms of him addressing spring breakers publicly.\u00a0 \u00a0 i will say that his message, broadly speaking, is that we are still at war with the virus.\u00a0 this is still a threat to the lives of the american people.\u00a0 we need to be vigilant.\u00a0 we need to wear masks.\u00a0 we need to hand wash.\u00a0 and that is a message, of course, directly to anybody who is not abiding by the recommendations of public health officials. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and if i could just \u2014 one more.\u00a0 do you have any update on the president\u2019s plans?\u00a0 will he be traveling to boulder? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any updates on that.\u00a0 as you all know, this tragedy only happened just about 36 hours ago.\u00a0 and obviously that would be done in consultation with local officials, who i\u2019m \u2014 who i know are still digesting the events and \u2014 in their community, working on healing in their community. \u00a0 i can note, since you reminded me, he did speak with the mayor this morning, as well, and he had spoken with the governor yesterday, and will remain in close touch. \u00a0 let me just go to the back, and then we\u2019ll come back.\u00a0 go ahead, in the back, lalit. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 last week, secretary blinken and nsa jake sullivan had a meeting in anchorage with chinese counterparts.\u00a0 have they \u2014 have they given the briefing to the president on the china policy?\u00a0 had \u2014 has it changed any chinese policy on the biden administration? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 all the \u2014 i know that the president has spoken with secretary blinken and national security advisor jake sullivan since their return.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any \u2014 obviously, they talked about a range of national security issues, ongoing policy processes that are ongoing.\u00a0 \u00a0 we\u2019re currently taking stock of where we are, which includes close consultation with allies and partners \u2014 as i noted, secretary of state is in brussels currently \u2014 on the way forward, and we\u2019ll continue to work with china going forward when it\u2019s in the interest of the american people.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we\u2019re in \u2014 consulting internally, consulting with our partners and allies, and that\u2019s really the stage we\u2019re in at this time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i have a question related to legal immigration.\u00a0 when vice president was a senator, she supported the cause of ead \u2014 employment authorization cards \u2014 for h4 and l2 visa holders.\u00a0 now these guys are saying \u2014 well, most of them are women, basically.\u00a0 they\u2019re saying there is a very long delay in issuing ead cards for h4 and l2 visa holders.\u00a0 some of them have also went to the court.\u00a0 what is your \u2014 why these delays there? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think part of the reason we want to push for action on immigration on the hill is to move forward with expediting the processing and doing that on several levels, including a number of the visas that you just \u2014 just introduced or just conveyed.\u00a0 so that\u2019s part of the reason why we think that\u2019s such an important piece to move forward on. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a final one: a number of indian american doctors whose job is to treat patients during this covid \u2014 covid era, they are on the hill protesting against and demanding elimination of country quota for green cards.\u00a0 i know the white house has sent a legislation to the hill and \u2014 that talks about that.\u00a0 but they\u2019re still protesting against \u2014 and faster implementation of that passage of that bill.\u00a0 what is president\u2019s message to those doctors? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think the president is \u2014 would reiterate that he believes that there should be faster processing, that our immigration system is broken at many levels, and \u2014 of the system, and that he is eager to \u2014 for congress to move forward with action there. \u00a0 okay, two in back.\u00a0 go ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 on \u2014 back on guns, you mentioned bipartisan meetings.\u00a0 i\u2019m wondering if you give a little bit more of a sense of the president\u2019s engagement with congress on gun legislation specifically.\u00a0 does he plan to have a bipartisan meeting on that at the white house?\u00a0 and has he spoken to senator manchin at all about his opposition to that background check bill? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any meetings to predict.\u00a0 obviously, you know, this is an issue that is \u2014 there are a number of passionate gun safety advocates on the hill, as you well know, who have strong views about what the path forward should look like. \u00a0so i have no doubt that he has discussed this issue with them over the course of the last two months of his presidency.\u00a0 \u00a0 as it relates to the tragedy of tuesday night, he was, of course in ohio all day yesterday with a very full schedule.\u00a0 so i don\u2019t \u2014 he didn\u2019t have any calls yesterday.\u00a0 but, you know, it\u2019s something that he will continue to look for ways to engage, to discuss, to advocate for action moving forward.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and is there an update on his joint session to congress? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no update yet.\u00a0 we have a speech coming up next week.\u00a0 and we \u2014 certainly, he remains interested in and committed to doing a joint session.\u00a0 we remain engaged with them, but i don\u2019t have an update on the specific timing.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and if i can just ask one more from one of the reporters in the pool who couldn\u2019t be here. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there was an axios report today that he met with historians to discuss how aggressive he could be on his economic agenda, among other topics.\u00a0 i\u2019m wondering if you can confirm the meeting, and maybe tell us who was involved and why he felt the need to meet with historians on this. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i will tell you: presidents love historians.\u00a0 i know this from \u2014 this is my second president working for.\u00a0 and, you know, i think it\u2019s important to learn from what worked and didn\u2019t work in the past and gain perspective from people who study that.\u00a0 \u00a0 so he did meet with historians a couple of weeks ago.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have the list of names in front of me.\u00a0 i can see if there\u2019s more details we can provide.\u00a0 and really, it\u2019s meant to have an open conversation about the challenges we\u2019re country \u2014 our country is facing and looking back at history.\u00a0 and it\u2019s a moment to step back and reflect and use it as lessons moving forward.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 a few on spending and one on taxes as well.\u00a0 i know you can\u2019t get into specifics at this point, but what the president is being briefed on by his economic team in the upcoming days, is this an infrastructure package?\u00a0 is it the president\u2019s build back better plan?\u00a0 a combination of both?\u00a0 give us an overview of what it is. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, our build back better agenda \u2014 his build back better agenda includes a number of components that he talked about on the campaign trail.\u00a0 infrastructure is part of it.\u00a0 making the tax code fair and one that rewards work, and not wealth, is part of it.\u00a0 doing better by our caregivers is part of that.\u00a0 increasing access to healthcare is part of it.\u00a0 investing in our clean energy economy is part of it.\u00a0 \u00a0 there are several components he talked about on the campaign trail. \u00a0and right now, what he\u2019s talking with his economic team and advisors about are \u2014 is what the scale, the scope, and the components will look like in what he\u2019s going to move forward and propose next week. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the $3 trillion number has been put out there.\u00a0 i know the white house hasn\u2019t confirmed that, but is it possible that it goes above $3 trillion?\u00a0 like, is $3 trillion viewed as the cap, or it\u2019s certainly possible it could go even higher? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, again, i think what we\u2019re looking at is all of those components, as i just laid out, all of which may not \u2014 will not be in a speech next week.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 this is a big \u2014 big components of his agenda that he talked about on the campaign trail.\u00a0 \u00a0 so \u2014 and right now, he\u2019s having a conversation about the scale and the scope of what proposals look like.\u00a0 there\u2019s lots of ways to frame it, to shape it, to size it, so i don\u2019t have any more to predict for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 last one on this, before taxes.\u00a0 speaking of size and scope, it\u2019s possible, if it gets broken up, that infrastructure could be won.\u00a0 so what does the president, what does the white house view as infrastructure?\u00a0 what falls under that umbrella? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 under infrastructure?\u00a0 there\u2019s a lot of ways to look at infrastructure.\u00a0 i can\u2019t preview for you \u2014 i know you\u2019re not exactly asking this \u2014 what will be in the package that he\u2019s still discussing.\u00a0 but obviously, roads, rails, and bridges are part of what everybody historically thinks about.\u00a0 but there\u2019s also components like our cyber infrastructure. \u00a0there\u2019s lots of ways to look at infrastructure.\u00a0 but how \u2014 what is in a package that he proposes in the coming months, i don\u2019t have anything more to detail for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, on taxes: the white house says now that families who make up to $400,000 won\u2019t pay a penny more under the president\u2019s potential plan \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 mm-hmm. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 to the federal government in taxes.\u00a0 so \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 which is 98 percent of families.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so what about individuals?\u00a0 if you\u2019re an individual and you make up to \u201cblank,\u201d you won\u2019t pay more to uncle sam.\u00a0 what is that number? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 $400,000. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so the individual number is going to be same as the joint filer number? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, the \u2014 no more \u2014 nobody \u2014 no individual making less than a hundred \u2014 four hundred thousand dollars will pay more in taxes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so if you\u2019re an individual and you make $300,000, let\u2019s just say, and you \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 that\u2019s less than 400, right?\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and you\u2019re a married couple that makes 300 and 150, that\u2019s more than 450.\u00a0 the 300 isn\u2019t going to \u2014 traditionally, taxes \u2014 the joint filers pay about \u2014 it\u2019s doubled.\u00a0 but you\u2019re saying now it will be the same rate? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think we\u2019ll have more to say when we actually roll out a tax proposal, which we have not done yet.\u00a0 so this is a commitment he made on the campaign trail, which he has committed to abiding by.\u00a0 but once we propose a tax proposal, we\u2019ll have more to discuss on it.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so just to be clear: individual filers, if you make up to $400,000 \u2014 you\u2019re an individual \u2014 you will not pay a penny more, just like families won\u2019t pay a penny more? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 that\u2019s right.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jen, quick one \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 as the pooler, from a tv colleague who can\u2019t be here today. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 can you give us an update on major and champ, and whether they are at the white house? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 oh, i was waiting for this to come up.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 we can end it on this one.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 of course.\u00a0 (laughs.)\u00a0 champ and major are here at the white house.\u00a0 they joined the first family at camp david last weekend and returned with them on sunday.\u00a0 the dogs will come and go, and it will not be uncommon for them to head back to delaware on occasion, as the president and first lady often do as well. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 is it about the dogs?\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on colin kahl \u2014 he\u2019s one of the president\u2019s nominees \u2014 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 for a top pentagon post.\u00a0 he barely just made it out of committee right now.\u00a0 can you say \u2014 is the white house still behind his nomination?\u00a0 it\u2019s been controversial from the beginning.\u00a0 any thoughts on that? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 absolutely.\u00a0 colin is qualified.\u00a0 he\u2019s experienced.\u00a0 and he would bring an incredible reservoir of perspective to the job at the department of defense.\u00a0 so we look forward to his confirmation. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so no consideration whatsoever of withdrawing his nomination? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 nope. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if i could close the loop on, kind of, the leader mcconnell question.\u00a0 you said they speak regularly.\u00a0 he says that they\u2019ve only spoken one time.\u00a0 he corrected his statement saying they spoke one time on burma.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 mm-hmm. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 have they spoken beyond that

have more to read out for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 has the president\u2019s definition of bipartisanship change since he arrived in office on january 20th?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no.\u00a0 his definition of bipartisanship has always been working on behalf of the american people and governing for all people \u2014 whether it\u2019s democrats, republicans, independents \u2014 and moving forward on proposals and policies that will make their lives better. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 with or without republican votes? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, he doesn\u2019t believe that bipartisanship is defined by the zip code here.\u00a0 he believes it\u2019s on how we can deliver relief to the american people. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay, thanks, everyone. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on omb, do you have any timing on when you might announce a replacement for neera tanden?\u00a0 now that \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i do not.\u00a0 but shalanda young is confirmed; she will be the acting.\u00a0 and so \u2014 but i don\u2019t have a personnel preview for you on that particular role. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jen, can i have one more question on china vaccine diplomacy?\u00a0 is the administration doing anything specific to push back against requirements by china for countries to cut back or reduce ties to taiwan?\u00a0 is the \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i will check with our national security team if there\u2019s anything for that on your \u2014 on that for you.\u00a0 \u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 \u00a0 1:32 p.m. edt"},

president:\u00a0 well, good afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 megan and margaret, thank you.\u00a0 thank you for being here.\u00a0 and to all your teammates virtually, thank you as well.\u00a0 i\u2019m an unadulterated fan.\u00a0 not a joke.\u00a0 not a joke.\u00a0 \u00a0 and both of you and your entire team \u2014 i\u2019m not joking \u2014 have inspired our daughters and our granddaughters, who, i might add, are all really good athletes: one two-time all-state; my niece, all-american.\u00a0 there\u2019s a whole lot of talent in the biden family athletics, almost all on the women\u2019s side of the equation.\u00a0 but i \u2014 really, thank you for what you\u2019ve done. \u00a0 you know, you\u2019re all heroes for so many people \u2014 and that\u2019s not hyperbole to suggest that \u2014 on and off the field.\u00a0 you know, and it matters that you lent your voice to the issues and the issue of fair pay and decency for so many years.\u00a0 \u00a0 megan, it\u2019s hard to believe it was almost a year ago that we met virtually during the campaign.\u00a0 i said it last april, when we spoke, and i\u2019ll say it again: the fact that jill and i get to talk with you and your teammates makes us heroes with our granddaughters.\u00a0 not a joke.\u00a0 i went so far as i took \u2014 they might may say \u2014 a privilege of getting our granddaughter maisy, who is a rising junior at the university of pennsylvania \u2014 up taking a course right now \u2014 i got her on the phone so she \u2014 all she wanted to do was meet both of these women and meet them virtually.\u00a0 and she\u2019s a soccer player.\u00a0 \u00a0 and as jill mentioned, seeing you win the world cup back in 2015, that was an incredible moment for our family and our country.\u00a0 and i didn\u2019t bore you with all the pictures we still have walking on the field \u2014 (laughter) \u2014 no, i\u2019m serious \u2014 and off the field.\u00a0 you all made me a hero with my granddaughters.\u00a0 \u00a0 and the reason we\u2019re here today is because it\u2019s equal pay day, which has been around for 25 years.\u00a0 it was declared 25 years ago \u2014 equal pay day \u2014 though not enough people know about that and \u2014 and they \u2014 as they should. \u00a0 you know, it\u2019s a day that measures how much longer women typically have to work to match what men make in a single year.\u00a0 that\u2019s what jill was talking about.\u00a0 and it\u2019s shocking when you look at the numbers.\u00a0 \u00a0 twelve years ago, when president obama and i came into office, the very first law we enacted was the lilly ledbetter fair pay act, and lilly was standing at our side.\u00a0 \u00a0 this year \u2014 that year, i should say, in 2009, we marked \u2014 equal pay day occurred in late april.\u00a0 by late april, women will have made, at that time, on average, what men make in 12 months.\u00a0 they had to go all the way through january, february, march, and april to catch up.\u00a0 that meant that it took women until april of 2009 to earn the same amount of money that a man made in all of 2008.\u00a0 \u00a0 another way to look at it is, it took more than 15 months for a woman to earn the same amount that a man made in 12.\u00a0 and more than three extra months \u2014 it\u2019s more than that.\u00a0 and it\u2019s even longer for women of color.\u00a0 and it\u2019s wrong.\u00a0 \u00a0 this year, equal pay day falls in late march, which is a little bit better, but not much \u2014 from late april to late march.\u00a0 and, frankly, we shouldn\u2019t be satisfied until equal pay day is no longer even necessary to mention at all.\u00a0 \u00a0 the reality though is that in nearly every job \u2014 more than 90 percent of the occupations \u2014 women still earn less than men: 82 cents on the dollar on average.\u00a0 for aapi women, it\u2019s 87 cents for every dollar a white man earns.\u00a0 for black women, it\u2019s 63 cents.\u00a0 for native american women, it\u2019s 60 cents.\u00a0 for hispanic women, it\u2019s 55 cents.\u00a0 \u00a0 it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re an electrician, an accountant, or part of the best damn soccer team in the world, the pay gap is real.\u00a0 and this team is living proof that you can be the very best at what you do and still have to fight for equal pay. \u00a0 you know, as jill mentioned, this pandemic has only exacerbated the problem.\u00a0 women are on the frontlines as essential workers, particularly women of color, in hospitals, grocery stores, childcare facilities, farms, factories, but they\u2019re still earning less.\u00a0 \u00a0 more than 2 million women have dropped out of the workforce since the pandemic started \u2014 2 million.\u00a0 and now we\u2019re at the lowest rate of women participation in the labor force that we\u2019ve been in more than 30 years.\u00a0 let me say it again: the lowest \u2014 the lowest percent of women in the workforce \u2014 had to go back 30 years to get to where we are today. \u00a0 a lot of that is because so much extra weight of caregiving and responsibility is falling on their shoulders.\u00a0 it causes women to miss work, cut hours, and leave their jobs and care for their children and aging loved ones.\u00a0 that in and of itself sows some discrimination.\u00a0 how many men are staying home and doing it, and the woman\u2019s staying in the workforce? \u00a0 it undermines financial security.\u00a0 and, by the way, it\u2019s hard.\u00a0 i was a single parent with two children after my first wife and daughter were killed well over 40 years ago.\u00a0 and the fact of the matter is, i was a u.s. senator.\u00a0 i was 29 years old.\u00a0 i was making $42,000 a year, and i couldn\u2019t afford help to take care of my kids while i worked.\u00a0 thankful- \u2014 thankfully, my mother \u2014 my sister gave up her job.\u00a0 my brother \u2014 they helped me raise my kids.\u00a0 \u00a0 it undermines financial security for women and families.\u00a0 it hurts our entire economy when we lose the talent and hard work of so many people. \u00a0 in the american rescue plan you\u2019ve heard so much about that we just passed, it was designed to address this core challenge.\u00a0 it puts money directly into the pockets of people who need it the most: $1,400 checks for 85 percent of american households.\u00a0 the hundredth million check has been deposited as of today, and many more are on the way.\u00a0 \u00a0 it also expanded the child care tax credit. and here\u2019s what that means, for those who don\u2019t know: right now, if you file for federal income tax, you get up to a $2,000 credit for each child.\u00a0 but if you need help the most, if you\u2019re making a minimum wage job and you don\u2019t have to \u2014 you don\u2019t make enough to pay federal income tax, then you don\u2019t get this credit.\u00a0 \u00a0 but because of the american rescue plan we passed, if you have two children under the age of six, for example, and you\u2019re making $7.25 an hour \u2014 which is the minimum wage that so many people are making \u2014 you\u2019ll get a check for $3,600 per child or $7,200.\u00a0 roughly, you get $500 a month mailed to you by the federal government.\u00a0 that\u2019s life-changing.\u00a0 \u00a0 the american rescue plan is going to cut poverty across the board in america by about 31 percent.\u00a0 and that\u2019s a significant lift up for women.\u00a0 the law provides $360 billion for funding state and local governments.\u00a0 what that means is that\u2019s going to prevent layoffs on jobs often held by women \u2014 nurses, teachers, healthcare workers, home healthcare aides \u2014 because the states have to balance their budget, because if they can\u2019t \u2014 because of the lack of income coming in without the help from the federal government \u2014 they\u2019ll have to lay off those essential workers. \u00a0 and the law also includes $130 billion to reopen our schools safely; $40 billion for \u2014 invest in childcare investments; $160 billion to get the country vaccinated and beat this pandemic.\u00a0 all this is going to give millions of women, including many moms and dads too, the freedom to rejoin the workforce and make the career choices that are best for them and their families. \u00a0 but there\u2019s so much more we need to do.\u00a0 so much more.\u00a0 we need the congress to pass the paycheck fairness act \u2014 the bill to remove loopholes in the law allowing employers to justify gender pay disparities.\u00a0 it would help hold employers accountable for systemic pay discrimination.\u00a0 it would help level the playing field for women and people of color by making it easier for workers to challenge the disparities as a group.\u00a0 it would increase pay transparency.\u00a0 \u00a0 by that, i mean, you know, there\u2019s a whole range of american corporations \u2014 if you sign the fortune 500 \u2014 you sign up with them, you cannot reveal \u2014 it says in your contract you cannot reveal your salary to another employee.\u00a0 why is that?\u00a0 they don\u2019t want me sitting there saying, \u201cwell, i\u2019m making $60,000.\u201d\u00a0 and the woman doing the same job, and she looks and said, \u201cyou\u2019re making 60?\u00a0 i\u2019m making 40.\u201d\u00a0 they actually try to hide it.\u00a0 that\u2019s what i mean by transparency.\u00a0 \u00a0 some employers may not allow you to know exactly, like i said, how much the person sitting next to you is making.\u00a0 some may even discipline you for asking that.\u00a0 that has to change.\u00a0 \u00a0 too often, secrecy is part of the problem.\u00a0 we know information is power.\u00a0 you can\u2019t solve the problem if you don\u2019t know you\u2019re not getting paid fairly.\u00a0 \u00a0 my administration is going to fight for equal pay \u2014 for it to become a reality for all women.\u00a0 it\u2019s about justice.\u00a0 it\u2019s about fairness.\u00a0 it\u2019s about living up to our values and who we are as a nation.\u00a0 equal pay makes all of us stronger. \u00a0 it\u2019s not just women who care about this.\u00a0 i\u2019ve been around the country.\u00a0 i\u2019ve gone right into union halls and asked the men in the room, \u201chow many of you \u2014 how would you feel if your wife or your sister didn\u2019t earn the same amount of money as the man doing the same job next to you?\u201d\u00a0 and you hear them say \u2014 you hear them respond they don\u2019t like it.\u00a0 why?\u00a0 when your spouse or your sister is making the same amount of money the man she\u2019s standing next is making, it means that when the hot water heater breaks, you can replace it.\u00a0 you can get four new tires on the car.\u00a0 it means everybody\u2019s life is made better in that family.\u00a0 \u00a0 let me close with this: that to come out of this crisis and build back better, we need to erase the gender pay gap by ensuring that women have access to good-paying jobs; by raising wages for working folks and fighting for the right to organize and collectively bargain, because we know unions lift women\u2019s wages even more than they lift men\u2019s; and by investing our care\u00a0\u2014 in our care infrastructure \u2014 our care infrastructure \u2014 in paid leave, childcare, homecare \u2014 so that people can care for their families and also go to work.\u00a0 \u00a0 there\u2019s a lot to do, but together we can ensure that our daughters have all the same rights and opportunities as our sons.\u00a0 and if we\u2019re able to do this, it\u2019ll be transformational for our nation. \u00a0that\u2019s the goal.\u00a0 that\u2019s what this is all about.\u00a0 that\u2019s what this team, all of you, are all about. \u00a0 let me make one more point.\u00a0 you know, i\u2019ve told my daughters, granddaughters from the time they got old enough to understand what i was saying \u2014 and i mean it: there\u2019s not a single thing a man can do that a woman can\u2019t do as well or better.\u00a0 not a single thing.\u00a0 \u00a0 i was among the first senators ever to appoint a woman to the naval academy.\u00a0 i was just able to, as president of the united states, appoint two women as four-star generals, who now are combatant commanders.\u00a0 three out of the six are combatant commanders, and they\u2019re women.\u00a0 women.\u00a0 there are so many, some in the congress, who were jet fighter pilots flying at twice the speed of sound.\u00a0 so many doing so much.\u00a0 \u00a0 but this soccer team, america\u2019s team, has done more to lift up people\u2019s sense of who they can be, particularly young girls and women, above anything that\u2019s been done.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, as president of the united states, i thank you.\u00a0 i thank you for the example you\u2019ve set and for your willingness to say, \u201clook, we\u2019re not going to take it anymore.\u00a0 we\u2019re not going to take it.\u201d\u00a0 figuratively speaking, \u201cyou can take my trophies, but you can\u2019t take my pride.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 as i said, my dad used to say, \u201cjoey, a job is\u2026\u201d \u2014 when he lost his job and had to get another one.\u00a0 we had to move.\u00a0 he\u2019d say, \u201cyou know, joey, a job is about a lot more than a paycheck.\u00a0 it\u2019s about your dignity.\u00a0 it\u2019s about respect.\u00a0 it\u2019s about your sense of yourself and your self-worth.\u00a0 it\u2019s about your place in the community.\u201d\u00a0 that\u2019s what this is all about, and that\u2019s why you guys are leading the way.\u00a0 \u00a0 and now it\u2019s my great pleasure and honor \u2014 i\u2019d like you to stand next to me, if you would, while i sign a proclamation making equal pay day \u2014 naming it \u2014 an expression of our commitment to seek equal pay as we build back better and restore this economic growth.\u00a0 \u00a0 thank you, folks.\u00a0 i\u2019m going to sign it now.\u00a0 come on over here.\u00a0 \u00a0 the title of the proclamation is \u201cnational equal pay day 2021.\u201d \u00a0 the first lady:\u00a0 you can move up.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 ms.

sent vaccines directly to local pharmacies and community health centers that disproportionately serve vulnerable populations; launched hundreds of mobile clinics to meet people where they are; and created the covid-19 health equity task force. these actions are garnering initial results. in the past two months, 60 percent of doses at federally-run community vaccination sites were administered to people of color. in the federal retail pharmacy program, 45 percent of sites were located in zip codes with high social vulnerability scores \u2013 a cdc index that uses 15 u.s. census variables to identify communities that may need support. finally, over 65 percent of the federal doses allocated to community health centers have been administered to people of color. but there is more work to do.\u00a0 that is why we\u2019re doubling down on the progress we are seeing through federal programs. today\u2019s announcements include: $6 billion investment in community health centers to expand access to vaccines in underserved communities.\u00a0 hhs will invest more than $6 billion from the american rescue plan into community health centers nationwide to expand covid-19 vaccinations, testing, and treatment for vulnerable populations; deliver preventive and primary health care services to people at higher risk for covid-19; and expand health centers\u2019 operational capacity during the pandemic and beyond, including modifying and improving physical infrastructure and adding mobile units. \u00a0the health resources and services administration (hrsa), will provide funding starting in april to nearly 1,400 centers across the country. community health centers serve 1 in 5 people living in rural communities. more than 91% of health center patients are individuals or families living at or below 200% of the federal poverty guidelines, and more than 60% are racial or ethnic minorities. for detailed information on how this funding is being distributed to health centers nationwide, including state-by-state breakdowns and an interactive health center funding map, please visit:\u00a0 https://bphc.hrsa.gov/program-opportunities/american-rescue-plan/awards . expanding eligibility for vaccines to patients served by community health centers . in addition to today\u2019s historic investment in community health centers, community health centers participating in the federal health center covid-19 vaccine program are invited to expand eligibility to populations in the acip\u2019s 1c eligibility tier \u2013 this includes frontline essential workers and all persons 16 years and older with high-risk medical conditions. this means approximately 83% of the adults seen at community health centers participating in the federal health center covid-19 vaccine program will now be eligible for vaccinations. this follows the president\u2019s announcement that all adults will be eligible for vaccinations no later than may 1. today\u2019s news will enable more people in need to receive vaccine doses. $3 billion to strengthen vaccine confidence. \u00a0hhs, through the centers for disease control and prevention (cdc), will invest $3 billion to support local efforts to increase vaccine uptake and equity. this funding will go directly to states, territories, and some large cities, enabling them to support local health departments and community-based organizations in launching new programs and initiatives intended to increase vaccine access, acceptance, and uptake. this funding will focus on reaching communities hit hardest by the pandemic, including those with a high social vulnerability index, minority communities, and rural areas. the awards will be made in early april and administered through cdc\u2019s existing immunization cooperative agreement with 64 jurisdictions. more than half of this funding is being made available thanks to the american rescue plan. examples of new programs this funding to jurisdictions could support include: launch a partnership to vaccinate dialysis patients.\u00a0 the administration is announcing a new partnership with dialysis clinics to provide covid-19 vaccinations to people receiving dialysis and health care personnel in outpatient dialysis clinics. kidney disease disproportionately affects racial and ethnic minorities as 34% of patients on dialysis are black and 19% are hispanic. people on dialysis who contract covid-19 often have severe health outcomes and have a 50% hospitalization rate and a mortality rate between 20-30% from covid-19. there are about 500,000 people in the u.s. who receive regular dialysis treatment. through this partnership, the administration will provide vaccines directly to dialysis treatment centers so patients who typically go three times a week for treatment are able to get vaccinated at their place of care. $330 million to invest in community health workers.\u00a0 hhs, through cdc, will provide $300 million to jurisdictions for community health worker services to support covid-19 prevention and control, and an additional $32 million for training, technical assistance, and evaluation. this funding will be used to address disparities in access to covid-19 related services, such as testing, contact tracing, and vaccinations, and it will help address factors that increase risk of severe covid-19 illness such as chronic diseases, pregnancy, and food insecurity. for example, this funding could support nurses who are serving hard-hit areas or local community health workers conducting outreach efforts to make those at highest risk aware of vaccination opportunities. this effort will benefit populations with increased prevalence of covid-19 and disproportionately impacted by long-standing health disparities related to sociodemographic characteristics, geographic regions, and economic strata. ###"},

roberts, vice president harris, speaker pelosi, leader schumer, leader mcconnell, vice president pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow americans. this is america\u2019s day. this is democracy\u2019s day. a day of history and hope. of renewal and resolve. through a crucible for the ages america has been tested anew and america has risen to the challenge. today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. we have learned again that democracy is precious. democracy is fragile. and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. so now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this capitol\u2019s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under god, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. we look ahead in our uniquely american way \u2013 restless, bold, optimistic \u2013 and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. i thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. i thank them from the bottom of my heart. you know the resilience of our constitution and the strength of our nation. as does president carter, who i spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. i have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took \u2014 an oath first sworn by george washington. but the american story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. on \u201cwe the people\u201d who seek a more perfect union. this is a great nation and we are a good people. over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. but we still have far to go. we will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. much to repair. much to restore. much to heal. much to build. and much to gain. few periods in our nation\u2019s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we\u2019re in now. a once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country. it\u2019s taken as many lives in one year as america lost in all of world war ii. millions of jobs have been lost. hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. the dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. a cry for survival comes from the planet itself. a cry that can\u2019t be any more desperate or any more clear. and now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. to overcome these challenges \u2013 to restore the soul and to secure the future of america \u2013 requires more than words. it requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: unity. unity. in another january in washington, on new year\u2019s day 1863, abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation. when he put pen to paper, the president said, \u201cif my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.\u201d my whole soul is in it. today, on this january day, my whole soul is in this: bringing america together. uniting our people. and uniting our nation. i ask every american to join me in this cause. uniting to fight the common foes we face: anger, resentment, hatred. extremism, lawlessness, violence. disease, joblessness, hopelessness. with unity we can do great things. important things. we can right wrongs. we can put people to work in good jobs. we can teach our children in safe schools. we can overcome this deadly virus. we can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all. we can deliver racial justice. we can make america, once again, the leading force for good in the world. i know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. i know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. but i also know they are not new. our history has been a constant struggle between the american ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. the battle is perennial. victory is never assured. through the civil war, the great depression, world war, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our \u201cbetter angels\u201d have always prevailed. in each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. and, we can do so now. history, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. we can treat each other with dignity and respect. we can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. for without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. no progress, only exhausting outrage. no nation, only a state of chaos. this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. and, we must meet this moment as the united states of america. if we do that, i guarantee you, we will not fail. we have never, ever, ever failed in america when we have acted together. and so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh. all of us. let us listen to one another. hear one another. see one another. show respect to one another. politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war. and, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. my fellow americans, we have to be different than this. america has to be better than this. and, i believe america is better than this. just look around. here we stand, in the shadow of a capitol dome that was completed amid the civil war, when the union itself hung in the balance. yet we endured and we prevailed. here we stand looking out to the great mall where dr. king spoke of his dream. here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in american history elected to national office \u2013 vice president kamala harris. don\u2019t tell me things can\u2019t change. here we stand across the potomac from arlington national cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. and here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground. that did not happen. it will never happen. not today. not tomorrow. not ever. to all those who supported our campaign i am humbled by the faith you have placed in us. to all those who did not support us, let me say this: hear me out as we move forward. take a measure of me and my heart. and if you still disagree, so be it. that\u2019s democracy. that\u2019s america. the right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our republic, is perhaps our nation\u2019s greatest strength. yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion. and i pledge this to you: i will be a president for all americans. i will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. many centuries ago, saint augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. what are the common objects we love that define us as americans? i think i know. opportunity. security. liberty. dignity. respect. honor. and, yes, the truth. recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. there is truth and there are lies. lies told for power and for profit. and each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as americans, and especially as leaders \u2013 leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation \u2014 to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. i understand that many americans view the future with some fear and trepidation. i understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next. i get it. but the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don\u2019t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don\u2019t get their news from the same sources you do. we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. if we show a little tolerance and humility. if we\u2019re willing to stand in the other person\u2019s shoes just for a moment. because here is the thing about life: there is no accounting for what fate will deal you. there are some days when we need a hand. there are other days when we\u2019re called on to lend one. that is how we must be with one another. and, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. my fellow americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. we will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. we are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. we must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. i promise you this: as the bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. we will get through this, together the world is watching today. so here is my message to those beyond our borders: america has been tested and we have come out stronger for it. we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. not to meet yesterday\u2019s challenges, but today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s. we will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example. we will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. we have been through so much in this nation. and, in my first act as president, i would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. to those 400,000 fellow americans \u2013 mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. we will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country. amen. this is a time of testing. we face an attack on democracy and on truth. a raging virus. growing inequity. the sting of systemic racism. a climate in crisis. america\u2019s role in the world. any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. but the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities. now we must step up. all of us. it is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. and, this is certain. we will be judged, you and i, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era. will we rise to the occasion? will we master this rare and difficult hour? will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children? i believe we must and i believe we will. and when we do, we will write the next chapter in the american story. it\u2019s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. it\u2019s called \u201camerican anthem\u201d and there is one verse stands out for me: \u201cthe work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day what shall be our legacy? what will our children say?\u2026 let me know in my heart when my days are through america america i gave my best to you.\u201d let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. if we do this then when our days are through our children and our children\u2019s children will say of us they gave their best. they did their duty. they healed a broken land. my fellow americans, i close today where i began, with a sacred oath. before god and all of you i give you my word. i will always level with you. i will defend the constitution. i will defend our democracy. i will defend america. i will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities. not of personal interest, but of the public good. and together, we shall write an american story of hope, not fear. of unity, not division. of light, not darkness. an american story of decency and dignity. of love and of healing. of greatness and of goodness. may this be the story that guides us. the story that inspires us. the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. we met the moment. that democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived. that our america secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. that is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. so, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. sustained by faith. driven by conviction. and, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts. may god bless america and may god protect our troops. thank you, america. end 12:13 pm est"}

{"header": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tfact sheet: biden-harris administration announces initial actions to address the gun violence public health epidemic\t\t\t\t\t\t", "date": "april 07, 2021", "text": "today, the biden-harris administration is announcing six initial actions to address the gun violence public health epidemic. the recent high-profile mass shootings in boulder \u2013 taking the lives of 10 individuals \u2013 and atlanta \u2013 taking the lives of eight individuals, including six asian american women \u2013 underscored the relentlessness of this epidemic. gun violence takes lives and leaves a lasting legacy of trauma in communities every single day in this country, even when it is not on the nightly news. in fact, cities across the country are in the midst of a historic spike in homicides, violence that disproportionately impacts black and brown americans. the president is committed to taking action to reduce all forms of gun violence \u2013 community violence, mass shootings, domestic violence, and suicide by firearm. president biden is reiterating his call for congress to pass legislation to reduce gun violence. last month, a bipartisan coalition in the house passed two bills to close loopholes in the gun background check system. congress should close those loopholes and go further, including by closing \u201cboyfriend\u201d and stalking loopholes that currently allow people found by the courts to be abusers to possess firearms, banning assault weapons and high capacity magazines, repealing gun manufacturers\u2019 immunity from liability, and investing in evidence-based community violence interventions. congress should also pass an appropriate national \u201cred flag\u201d law, as well as legislation incentivizing states to pass \u201cred flag\u201d laws of their own. but this administration will not wait for congress to act to take its own steps \u2013 fully within the administration\u2019s authority and the second amendment \u2013 to save lives. today, the administration is announcing the following six initial actions: the justice department, within 30 days, will issue a proposed rule to help stop the proliferation of \u201cghost guns.\u201d \u00a0we are experiencing a growing problem: criminals are buying kits containing nearly all of the components and directions for finishing a firearm within as little as 30 minutes and using these firearms to commit crimes. when these firearms turn up at crime scenes, they often cannot be traced by law enforcement due to the lack of a serial number. the justice department will issue a proposed rule to help stop the proliferation of these firearms. the justice department, within 60 days, will issue a proposed rule to make clear when a device marketed as a stabilizing brace effectively turns a pistol into a short-barreled rifle subject to the requirements of the national firearms act.\u00a0 the alleged shooter in the boulder tragedy last month appears to have used a pistol with an arm brace, which can make a firearm more stable and accurate while still being concealable. the justice department, within 60 days, will publish model \u201cred flag\u201d legislation for states.\u00a0 red flag laws allow family members or law enforcement to petition for a court order temporarily barring people in crisis from accessing firearms if they present a danger to themselves or others. the president urges congress to pass an appropriate national \u201cred flag\u201d law, as well as legislation incentivizing states to pass \u201cred flag\u201d laws of their own. in the interim, the justice department\u2019s published model legislation will make it easier for states that want to adopt red flag laws to do so. the administration is investing in evidence-based community violence interventions. \u00a0community violence interventions are proven strategies for reducing gun violence in urban communities through tools other than incarceration. because cities across the country are experiencing a historic spike in homicides, the biden-harris administration is taking a number of steps to prioritize investment in community violence interventions. the justice department will issue an annual report on firearms trafficking. \u00a0in 2000, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms (atf) issued a report summarizing information regarding its investigations into firearms trafficking, which is one way firearms are diverted into the illegal market where they can easily end up in the hands of dangerous individuals. since the report\u2019s publication, states, local, and federal policymakers have relied on its data to better thwart the common channels of firearms trafficking. but there is good reason to believe that firearms trafficking channels have changed since 2000, for example due to the emergence of online sales and proliferation of \u201cghost guns.\u201d the justice department will issue a new, comprehensive report on firearms trafficking and annual updates necessary to give policymakers the information they need to help address firearms trafficking today. the president will nominate david chipman to serve as director of the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms.\u00a0 atf is the key agency enforcing our gun laws, and it needs a confirmed director in order to do the job to the best of its ability. but atf has not had a confirmed director since 2015. chipman served at atf for 25 years and now works to advance commonsense gun safety laws. ###"},

\u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 nice to see all of you.\u00a0 and it\u2019s an honor for me to be here to talk a little bit about president biden\u2019s american jobs plan. \u00a0 at its core, the american jobs plan is about making sure every american has the opportunity to get a decent job.\u00a0 a decent, well-paying job, with dignity and has opportunity. \u00a0 it\u2019s a historic investment in america, intended to create tens of millions of jobs, rebuild our country\u2019s infrastructure, and position the united states to outcompete china. \u00a0 many have commented that it\u2019s large, it\u2019s bold.\u00a0 it\u2019s necessarily large because, frankly, we\u2019re behind, and we\u2019ve neglected for too long important investments in our infrastructure.\u00a0 \u00a0 we need to ensure that investments in infrastructure, advanced manufacturing, workforce development, and our care economy are made \u2014 are made at the scale we need and are made in every single community in america. \u00a0 and as the president has \u2014 has led us to \u2014 is leading us to build back better, that means we need to do so more inclusively and ensure that these investments that we are making \u2014 in broadband, in housing, in the care economy, in water \u2014 are in every community in america: rural, tribal, urban, communities of color, and reaching everyone across america.\u00a0 \u00a0 the fact is, we have failed for a long time to invest.\u00a0 and as a result, we have fallen behind.\u00a0 so why does that matter?\u00a0 it matters because it makes it harder for small businesses to compete.\u00a0 it makes \u2014 it matters because it makes it harder for american companies to compete, and it makes it harder for the average american to get a decent job and to get the skills they need in order to get a high-paying job in the industries that are growing today and tomorrow.\u00a0 \u00a0 and the fact of the matter is, we know that lack of investment, particularly in public transportation, transit, water, housing, has hurt low-income folks and people of color the most.\u00a0 and it\u2019s time to finally rectify that systemic inequality and build back better and more equally. \u00a0 as jen said, my job as the commerce secretary is to do everything i can to enable american businesses of all sizes to compete.\u00a0 and at its core, the american jobs plan is about investing in american competitiveness, strengthening our workforce, rebuilding infrastructure, and leveling the playing field so all americans have a shot at a good job.\u00a0 \u00a0 now, prior to being commerce secretary, i was governor for six years. \u00a0prior to that, i was in the private sector.\u00a0 and so over the course of my career, as an entrepreneur and as governor, now as commerce secretary, i have had many, many, many discussions with businesses, from the biggest to the smallest.\u00a0 and over the years, there is something that we all seem to agree on, which is that we need to make massive investments in our infrastructure if we are going to compete and ensure america\u2019s global competitiveness.\u00a0 \u00a0 and most recently, i have spent a lot of time in the past few weeks talking to business leaders, and i can report to you that there\u2019s a broad level of enthusiasm for big investments in infrastructure.\u00a0 and i think there is a recognition that president biden is doing the right thing in pushing us to conceive of infrastructure as broad, as including investments in stem, research and development, investments in basic research, investments in broadband, investments in training our workforce.\u00a0 and the truth of it is, that\u2019s what it\u2019s going to take to compete.\u00a0 \u00a0 a key component of the american jobs plan is training our workforce.\u00a0 this is a reality.\u00a0 the changes in the american economy, many of which have been massively accelerated by covid, are very scary for millions of americans.\u00a0 it\u2019s a scary place to be to need a job and not have the skills to get a good job. \u00a0 and so that\u2019s why this package calls for big investments in training our workforce.\u00a0 now, as jen said, this was a priority of mine when i was governor, and i saw it work.\u00a0 i know it works.\u00a0 we saw it work.\u00a0 \u00a0 when i ran for governor, my state, rhode island \u2014 if you haven\u2019t been, i want you to go \u2014 had the highest unemployment rate in the country.\u00a0 number one in america.\u00a0 it was sad \u2014 very sad.\u00a0 the unemployment rate in the building trades when i took over was over 20 percent.\u00a0 think about what that does to a community. \u00a0 when i \u2014 before covid, after a lot of our work, rhode island had more jobs than at any time in our state\u2019s history, because we leaned into it in a broad fashion, similar to what this package calls for: investments in infrastructure, working with business, and big investments in work or training.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, the fact of the matter is, in order to compete, we have to have investments in apprenticeships, community colleges, stem education, job training.\u00a0 \u00a0 my view is: if you have the guts, in the middle of your career, to go out and get some job training to retrain yourself to get a new job, then we need to be there for you to provide high-quality, demand-driven, affordable \u2014 if not free \u2014 job training. \u00a0 the american jobs plan also is about strengthening our supply chains, making things in america, making critical goods in america, creating good jobs in the process, and increasing the security that we have, knowing that we aren\u2019t overly dependent on other countries for critical supplies.\u00a0 we saw that on full displaying in covid.\u00a0 every governor knows what it\u2019s like to be up in the middle of the night \u2014 can\u2019t get your hands on ppe or ventilators or medicine because they aren\u2019t manufactured in america. \u00a0 we also need to invest in domestic manufacturing, particularly for critical industries like semiconductors.\u00a0 we all know semiconductors are the building blocks of our future economy.\u00a0 and as we go through the data and digital revolution, semiconductors underpin so much of the new technology where we\u2019ll see job creation.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we\u2019ve \u2014 we are living through now a global chip shortage.\u00a0 we\u2019re seeing that hurt businesses in every sector, and so we need to strengthen our domestic supply chains.\u00a0 the american jobs plan calls for a $50 billion investment in semiconductor manufacturing and research, as it\u2019s called for in the bipartisan chips act.\u00a0 \u00a0 finally, we need strong investments in our broadband infrastructure.\u00a0 we\u2019ve seen more clearly than ever before that high-quality, affordable broadband isn\u2019t a luxury, but it\u2019s a necessity for education, jobs, and healthcare.\u00a0 but millions and millions of americans don\u2019t have access to broadband, particularly in rural communities.\u00a0 \u00a0 i finally want to address one last component, which is the investments in the care economy.\u00a0 you might say to yourself, \u201cwhy is the commerce secretary talking about investments in the care economy?\u201d\u00a0 because it matters.\u00a0 it is core to our competitiveness.\u00a0 in order for you to be able to go to work, you need to know that your loved one is being taken care of.\u00a0 \u00a0 and also, we have millions and millions of women, mostly women of color, working full-time, caring for our loved ones, living in poverty.\u00a0 it\u2019s time to make those investment so they can have a dignified job and so that we can shore up our communities. \u00a0 as jen said, i did a lot of work of this as governor.\u00a0 and it\u2019s something that i\u2019m very proud of president biden and to be on the team of a president who\u2019s investing in the care economy.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, fundamentally, this plan invests in american workers and businesses, small and large alike, so they can compete and win in the global marketplace. \u00a0and i\u2019m psyched to talk to you about it and proud to be on the team that\u2019s going to get this done. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 kristen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 thank you, secretary raimondo, for being here.\u00a0 as you know, some republicans have looked at this plan and said: if you increase the corporate tax rate overall in the long run, jobs could be eliminated.\u00a0 they cite one study, the tax foundation, that says that increasing the corporate tax rate will eliminate 159,000 jobs over the next 10 to 30 years.\u00a0 how do you respond to that criticism that in the long run this plan kills jobs? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 i don\u2019t agree with that assessment.\u00a0 so, a few \u2014 a few points.\u00a0 \u00a0 first of all, every business leader i talk to, big and small, agrees we must make these investments in infrastructure in order to compete.\u00a0 if we don\u2019t invest in semiconductors, we\u2019re going to fall further behind.\u00a0 if we don\u2019t invest in job training, we\u2019re not going to have the workforce that businesses need to compete.\u00a0 so it\u2019s essential that we make these investments. \u00a0 with respect to taxes, there is not a shred of evidence to show that the cuts in 2017 increased growth or productivity.\u00a0 actually, very little of it went into additional r&d.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, the fact of the matter is, the corporate structure today is broken.\u00a0 many, many companies don\u2019t pro- \u2014 large profitable companies pay no corporate taxes.\u00a0 so i\u2019d like to think we can all agree that it needs to be improved, level the playing field, close the loopholes, and have a discussion around how we do this together to improve competitiveness. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if it is raised to 28 percent, though, that would put the u.s. at one of the highest in the world.\u00a0 does it have to be 28 percent?\u00a0 would you go lower?\u00a0 could you accomplish the same thing if the tax rate weren\u2019t raised to 28 percent? \u00a0 secretary raimonodo: \u00a0so, there is room for compromise; that is clear. \u00a0the president has said a few things: we have to get this investment done. \u00a0he\u2019s charged us to work across the aisle and in a bipartisan way, and to \u2014 and we need to pay for what we\u2019re doing. \u00a0like, our proposal is to invest in 8 years and pay it back over 15. \u00a0 \u00a0 now, we can have a discussion about that.\u00a0 should we pay it back over 20 instead of 15?\u00a0 is the rate not quite 28?\u00a0 is it something, you know, lower?\u00a0 so we\u2019re \u2014 we want to compromise.\u00a0 \u00a0 what we cannot do, and what i am imploring the business community not to do, is to say, \u201cwe don\u2019t like 28.\u00a0 we\u2019re walking away.\u00a0 we\u2019re not discussing.\u201d\u00a0 that\u2019s unacceptable.\u00a0 come to the table and problem-solve with us to come up with a reasonable, responsible plan. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 mario. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, madam secretary.\u00a0 two questions for you.\u00a0 on the infrastructure side, how do you target and make sure that those projects help minority communities?\u00a0 i\u2019m thinking of the situation in jackson, mississippi, for example; flint as well.\u00a0 \u00a0 and then my other question is: how do you make sure that minorities are the beneficiaries of these jobs.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 there\u2019s been a long history of programs that were built to help minorities \u2014 i\u2019m thinking of opportunity zones with the last administration \u2014 that didn\u2019t ultimately help minorities. \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 yeah, really good question.\u00a0 two things.\u00a0 so, again, the president has been very clear in this; this is about equity in everything we do.\u00a0 and i\u2019m going to \u2014 i can promise you as commerce secretary \u2014 like, right now, we have $3 billion from the rescue package to invest in communities \u2014 i promise you now, equity is front and center.\u00a0 and that\u2019s why i was saying we have to get the money everywhere \u2014 rural, tribal, urban \u2014 and prioritizing those who have been left behind.\u00a0 \u00a0 with respect to the job training \u2014 you know, i can fall on my own experience \u2014 we did a back-to-work rhode island job training initiative, and we said we\u2019re going to tar- \u2014 we\u2019re going to make sure it\u2019s equitable.\u00a0 more than half of the people trained were women; more than 25 percent were people of color.\u00a0 if you commit yourself to it, which is what we will do under the president\u2019s leadership, we will make sure to make up for the fact that, as you say, in the past that hasn\u2019t been done. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 alex. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 what is the status and direction of the china tech policy review?\u00a0 and more specifically, what about tiktok?\u00a0 \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 yeah.\u00a0 so, this \u2014 i\u2019ll say quickly: we need to play offense and defense.\u00a0 the jobs package is offense: invest in america competitiveness so we can play offense.\u00a0 a lot of the tools that commerce has are defense: the entities list, tariffs, et cetera.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we are \u2014 you know, led by jake sullivan and our team interagency review \u2014 we\u2019re in the process of doing it now.\u00a0 a lot of people have said,  it\u2019s probably  \u201c[is huawei]* going to stay on the entity list?\u201d\u00a0 i have no reason to believe that they won\u2019t, but we\u2019re kind of in the middle of the overall review of the china policy. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how close is that to being completed? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 i would actually defer that more to the white house.\u00a0 but i would say we\u2019re \u2014 we\u2019re in the thick of it right now.\u00a0 like we\u2019re working as aggressively as we can.\u00a0 we\u2019re not wasting time on it. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 zeke. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, secretary.\u00a0 i was hoping to draw on your experience as governor, with regard to the virus.\u00a0 the white house and the president have been calling on governors across the country not to roll back virus restric- \u2014 virus restrictions, business capacity limitations, and the like.\u00a0 yet, many, including many democratic governors, have rolled back those policies steadily, even as cases have risen.\u00a0 you faced some of these struggles as governor.\u00a0 can you speak to a little bit of what those governors are facing?\u00a0 and how would you advise them to balance their, you know, maybe their pressures at home versus the federal guidance here to keep those restrictions in place? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 so it\u2019s a tough spot.\u00a0 to be a governor in america today is a challenge, and everyone is, you know, trying hard.\u00a0 i would say, first of all, they are so lucky that president biden is in office now, after what we went through last year.\u00a0 \u00a0 secondly, follow the president\u2019s lead around vaccinations.\u00a0 the administration is doing a fantastic job getting vaccinations out the door.\u00a0 and i think that it\u2019s a balance.\u00a0 listen, every governor knows what\u2019s going on in their community.\u00a0 and i think we have to respect that.\u00a0 they \u2014 you know, they see what\u2019s going on in their community.\u00a0 \u00a0 having said that, i would say, you know, the administration \u2014 the biden administration is focused heavily on vaccinations.\u00a0 it has a fantastic strategy.\u00a0 and i would just encourage governors to lean into that, vaccinate people as quickly as possible, and don\u2019t \u2014 just don\u2019t jump the gun.\u00a0 i am not going to tell governors what to do.\u00a0 i just have lived it, and every time you jump the gun, you live to regret it.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, vaccinate.\u00a0 put the pedal to the metal on vaccinating more than lifting restrictions. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 ed. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 madam secretary, thank you for being here.\u00a0 you oversee a big department \u2014 everything from the weather service to the fisheries and the census.\u00a0 have you been briefed on the status of getting the results of the 2020 census? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 yes, i have. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 when\u2019s it coming? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 well, we think \u2014 we have said that the redistricting data will be available no later than september 30th.\u00a0 if it\u2019s available before that, in a \u2014 you know, when we feel comfortable about it, we\u2019ll put it out then, but we need a little bit more time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 to state elections officials, secretaries of state who are sitting there, you know, scratching their head over which lines they should be using for elections this year \u2014 \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and next year, what do you say to them? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 i say: i know it\u2019s tough, but be patient.\u00a0 you know, last year was a \u2014 was a once-in-a-lifetime pandemic.\u00a0 the census professionals had to do the census in the middle of a global pandemic with covid, civil unrest through the summer.\u00a0 so, we\u2019re behind.\u00a0 you know, we are behind.\u00a0 \u00a0 but my direction to the team is: we have to get it right.\u00a0 so i \u2014 having been a local politician, i hear \u2014 look, i hear them.\u00a0 but the fact of the matter is, it is so much better to wait a little longer and have accurate data that we all can trust.\u00a0\u00a0 so i \u2014 we\u2019re \u2014 rest assured, if it\u2019s ready before the 30th, we\u2019ll put it out.\u00a0 but we are prioritizing accuracy over rushing it out.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there\u2019s one wonky bit of this, though, and it\u2019s the subject of lawsuits \u2014 differential privacy, where the idea of using essentially funky math to sort out some of this.\u00a0 have you been briefed on that?\u00a0 and do you think that was a good idea at this point to have done it that way?\u00a0 would you just recommend doing it that way in the future? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 so, in this regard, i have to rely on the experts.\u00a0 the experts at the census bureau are top-notch \u2014 career, top-notch statisticians and demographers. \u00a0 here\u2019s the reality: that \u2014 what you\u2019re referring to is a statistical technique that is intended to protect people\u2019s privacy.\u00a0 it\u2019s the first time we\u2019ve used it. \u00a0 today, the way quantum computing and computing is such that we \u2014 there can be privacy hacks today that weren\u2019t technologically available 10 years ago.\u00a0 so in order for us to keep up with that and protect people\u2019s privacy, we have to implement new techniques, and this is one of those new techniques.\u00a0 so, yes, i think it\u2019s justified. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 cecilia, you\u2019re going to be the last one.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 but we\u2019ll invite her back.\u00a0 we\u2019ll invite her back. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, madam secretary.\u00a0 two quick ones on infrastructure for you.\u00a0 a friend of this white house, senator chris coons, said today that he thinks it\u2019s more likely that democrats ultimately will end up with a less robust \u2014 this is his words \u2014 infrastructure package.\u00a0 he says it\u2019s \u2014 could end up looking one that\u2019s \u2014 like one that\u2019s more directly targeted\u00a0at what he\u2019s calling \u201chard infrastructure.\u201d\u00a0 is that an accurate prediction to you at this stage?\u00a0 \u00a0 and then, my second question \u2014 i\u2019ll just tack it on here:\u00a0the president \u2014 you\u2019re one of the five cabinet secretaries that president biden tapped to, kind of, go out and sell this \u2014 his words \u2014 to engage the public.\u00a0 what has that entailed at this point, specifically as it relates to getting these republicans on board with this plan? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 talking to them.\u00a0 you know, sitting down, listening, engaging them.\u00a0 as i said before, we have put forth a bold proposal and a reasonable way to pay for it.\u00a0 there are other ideas.\u00a0 \u00a0 so what i\u2019m going to do \u2014 and all the cabinet is doing and the white house \u2014 is sitting down with our republicans friends and democrats and business leaders and saying, \u201cokay, if you don\u2019t like this, what\u2019s your idea?\u00a0 how do you think we ought to pay for it?\u201d\u00a0 if we \u2014 you know, \u201cwe are proposing paying for it over 15 years.\u00a0 what do you think?\u201d \u00a0 so i think, again, it\u2019s all about finding that compromise and actually delivering for the american people.\u00a0 so that \u2014 anyway, i think broad engagement.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 how many republicans have you had face-to-face conversations with? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 if you include zoom as face-to-face \u2014 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 \u2014 i would say very many.\u00a0 only a few actually face-to-face, but a lot.\u00a0 you know, a lot.\u00a0 and i plan to do even more of it.\u00a0 like, we\u2019re serious about this.\u00a0 we want to get this done.\u00a0 there\u2019s a lot of different ways to do it.\u00a0 the president does what a leader does: puts forth his ideas.\u00a0 now let\u2019s get to work.\u00a0 let\u2019s talk about it.\u00a0 where do we tweak it?\u00a0 where do we change it? \u00a0 with respect to senator coons, i am not going to disagree with his assessment because he\u2019s been up here longer than my four weeks.\u00a0 but, look, i think it\u2019s early to say.\u00a0 the president put his plan out a week ago.\u00a0 let\u2019s give it a shot; let\u2019s go big.\u00a0 \u00a0 i can tell you this: every single business leader i\u2019ve talked to applauds the fact that this package is more than just roads, bridges, and water.\u00a0 like, come on, 35 percent of americans in rural areas don\u2019t have broadband.\u00a0 you cannot have a modern economy without that.\u00a0 we have a crisis in semiconductor manufacturing. \u00a0you cannot have a modern economy without that.\u00a0 \u00a0 so i hope that that isn\u2019t where we settle because we\u2019d be shortchanging the american people \u2014 workers and businesses. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 could you take one more? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 all right, jeff.\u00a0 you\u2019re so convincing. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 secretary, just to follow up on alex\u2019s question about tiktok: can you just clarify what your position is on whether tiktok needs to be sold by the chinese company bytedance that owns it now?\u00a0 and can you also give us a broad view of your advice to president biden on tariffs with regard to china? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 so, i would say \u2014 here\u2019s my broad view, and i don\u2019t want to get into details on any particular company.\u00a0 my broad view is: what we do on offense is more important than what we do on defense.\u00a0 \u00a0 to compete in the long run with china, we need to rebuild america in all of the ways we\u2019re talking about today \u2014 and, by the way, do that with our allies.\u00a0 you know, we have to work with our allies and find common ground where we can. \u00a0 with respect to tariffs, there is a place for tariffs.\u00a0 you know the 232 tariffs on steel and aluminum have, in fact, helped save american jobs in the steel and aluminum industries.\u00a0 so what do we do with tariffs?\u00a0 we have to level the playing field.\u00a0 no one can outcompete the american worker if the playing field is leveled.\u00a0 \u00a0 and the fact is china has \u2014 china\u2019s actions are uncompetitive, coercive, underhanded.\u00a0 they\u2019ve proven they\u2019ll do whatever it takes.\u00a0 \u00a0 and so i plan to use all the tools in my toolbox, as aggressively as possible, to protect american workers and businesses from unfair chinese practices. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yamiche, i don\u2019t want to leave you hanging.\u00a0 and you were the last one hanging.\u00a0 at the risk, yamiche. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no, this is great.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0thank you, madam secretary.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 hopefully the secretary will come back after this, but go ahead. \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 it depends what she asks.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah.\u00a0 (laughs.) \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 right.\u00a0 (laughs.)\u00a0 now it\u2019s a lot of pressure.\u00a0 but thank you for taking my question, madam secretary. \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what do you say to a business owner who\u2019s looking at the u.s. and wondering, \u201cwhy should i start a company here when i could possibly do so in another country more cheaply?\u201d\u00a0 how do we stay competitive, as the united states, for that business owner\u2019s company? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 so, i\u2019d say a few things.\u00a0 one, you cannot get better than american workers, american ingenuity, american innovation.\u00a0 two, this jobs plan will enhance american competitiveness.\u00a0 you know, i know from being governor, businesses want to locate in communities with good infrastructure, good public transportation, clean water, excellent public schools.\u00a0 that\u2019s where businesses want to be. that\u2019s where their employees want to work.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, if we pass this package, it will massively \u2014 businesses will want to be here \u2014 will want to be here more than they do now. \u00a0 also, the whole point of the tax reform as proposed by the administration is to get rid of the loopholes, level the playing field between big businesses and small businesses.\u00a0 i don\u2019t know any small businesses in rhode island who are shielding their profits in tax havens around the world.\u00a0 like, it\u2019ll level the playing field, raise more money, and allow us to invest in job creating, infrastructure, and job training. \u00a0 so, as a former business owner and as a former governor who recruited businesses, i think it\u2019s a winner for business. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is there an alternative other than the 28 percent?\u00a0 it sounds like it\u2019s a little open. \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what else could the white house come up with to pay for the infrastructure bill? \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 let\u2019s have the discussion.\u00a0 let us have the discussion.\u00a0 we put a plan out.\u00a0 tell us what you think is an alternative, reasonable plan.\u00a0 but i would say: don\u2019t shortchange america. \u00a0don\u2019t come back and say we only need a half a billion dollars of infrastructure, because we don\u2019t; because if we do that, we\u2019ll be in the same place or a worse place 10 years from now. \u00a0 so, yes, we\u2019re wide op- \u2014 reasonable people can disagree; we\u2019ll find compromise.\u00a0 but let\u2019s go big, and let\u2019s do what\u2019s required. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 all right.\u00a0 thank you so much for joining us. \u00a0 secretary raimondo:\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 bye.\u00a0 i can\u2019t believe that you do this every day.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 i always wanted to know. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 you don\u2019t.\u00a0 (laughter.) \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 you\u2019re here, right.\u00a0 lots of questions about covid and iran. \u00a0 a couple of other items for you all at the top.\u00a0 a new survey, just yesterday, from invest in america and data for progress found that 73 percent of voters backed the american jobs plan.\u00a0 that includes the support of 57 percent of republican voters.\u00a0 dig into \u2014 digging into the numbers shows just how broad the support is: 68 percent of independents, 64 percent of republicans back the president\u2019s proposed investment in the care economy \u2014 something the secretary just talked about quite a bit.\u00a0 and all of the investments the survey looked at \u2014 from roads and bridges, to housing, clean energy, and manufacturing \u2014 have the support of over 60 percent of voters and a majority of independents.\u00a0 \u00a0 the evidence is unanimous that the american people support the president\u2019s vision of rebuilding our economy and his plan to pay for it by asking big corporations to pay their fair share.\u00a0 \u00a0 a morning consult poll, just last week, showed that 2-to-1 registered voters back a hypothetical $3 trillion infrastructure package.\u00a0 and an earlier data for progress poll showed that by a 35 percent margin, voters want to pay for this plan by asking the wealthy and big corporations to pay their fair share. \u00a0 another update: today, we can proudly say that in addition to the 150 million shots in arms, we have successfully sent over 150 million relief checks to the american people.\u00a0 the fourth batch of the american \u2014 of the economic impact payments from the american rescue plan totals more than 25 million payments, which brings the total dispersed so far to more than 156 million payments, totaling $372 billion since the plan was signed into law less than a month ago. \u00a0 the largest block of these latest payments went to social security beneficiaries who didn\u2019t file a 2020 or 2019 tax return and didn\u2019t use the non-filers tool last year, which is consistent with our, you know, view that it would be more challenging \u2014 the easiest would be those who had information that the irs had, and it would become more challenging.\u00a0 so this is a more challenging group, but this is certainly good news. \u00a0 within two weeks of the american rescue plan becoming law, the irs and treasury had started dispersing 170 million payments.\u00a0 at a similar point during the first round of economic impact payments authorized a year ago, the first payments had yet to be completed.\u00a0 so just to give you a point of comparison. \u00a0 it\u2019s also important to note \u2014 and i know there\u2019s been some coverage of this \u2014 the irs has consistently underfunded \u2014 has been consistently underfunded with 20,000 fewer staff available to help americans.\u00a0 that\u2019s over the last 10 years \u2014 20,000 fewer.\u00a0 and our commitment is also to working on this problem and hiring more personnel at the irs. \u00a0 the president\u2019s rescue plan secured an additional $1.5 billion to help the irs get checks out \u2014 out checks and modernize.\u00a0 and we are pleased that, since the beginning of this administration, the inherited backlog of 2019 returns has been cut in half. \u00a0 one other update \u2014 two others, sorry.\u00a0 \u201cgood news you can use\u201d \u2014 i\u2019ll put it in that category.\u00a0 health and human services secretary becerra announced that more than 500,000 americans have already signed up for coverage on healthcare.gov since the beginning of the special enrollment period.\u00a0 nearly 15 million americans who currently lack health insurance and many current enrollees are eligible.\u00a0 an average of four out of five consumers currently enrolled in marketplace coverage can now find a plan for $10 or less a month after the tax credits. \u00a0 finally, the first lady announced earlier today \u2014 was joined by \u2014 virtually by u.s. military families, advocates, and stakeholders from around the world, as she set forth the priorities of joining forces.\u00a0 she spent the last few months hearing directly from military families, caregivers, survivors, and visiting military installations across the country.\u00a0 \u00a0 the mission of joining forces is to support those who also serve.\u00a0 the work and priorities of joining forces will center on the needs of military families in the areas of employment and entrepreneurship, military child education, and health and wellbeing.\u00a0 it was important that she relaunch this initiative within the first 100 days. \u00a0 with that, zeke. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 a couple foreign policy ones to get started.\u00a0 first, there was some confusion yesterday about the u.s. policy with regard to the beijing olympics next year.\u00a0 is it the u.s. policy now that american athletes will participate in those olympics?\u00a0 and is the u.s. government going to encourage american spectators to travel to china to view those games? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, these are the winter olympics of next winter, i should say.\u00a0 so some time away, as it relates to the second part of your question.\u00a0 and certainly our hope is that we are at a point where enough people across the country \u2014 and hopefully around the world \u2014 have been vaccinated.\u00a0 but we will rely on health and medical experts on that particular piece. \u00a0 our position on the 2022 olympics has not changed.\u00a0 we have not discussed and are not discussing any joint boycott with allies and partners.\u00a0 we, of course, consult closely with allies and partners at all levels to define our common concerns and establish a shared approach, but there\u2019s no discussion underway of a change in our plans regarding the beijing olympics from the united states\u2019 point of view. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 two questions on timelines: one, with regards to the ongoing talks in geneva right now regarding the jcpoa.\u00a0 what is the time \u2014 timetable for bringing iran back into compliance in terms of the breakout time for the (inaudible) potential of nuclear weapon? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 the timeline for getting them back at the table for direct \u2014 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 yeah.\u00a0 what is the ultimate timeline in terms of getting them back to the table?\u00a0 not the timeline for this specific round of talks, but longer-term timetable to get them back into compliance. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, look, first, i would say, you know, the talks are continuing today in vienna. \u00a0it\u2019s only the second day of talks. \u00a0 \u00a0 you may have seen a tweet from one of the european officials attending who called this \u2014 said, \u201cthere\u2019s unity and ambition,\u201d and that was their description of the conversations.\u00a0 \u00a0 this is just a constructive early step.\u00a0 we\u2019re at the early part of the process here.\u00a0 the primary issues, as you know, that will be discussed are both steps that would need to be taken for iran to come back into compliance and the sanctions relief steps that the united states would need to take.\u00a0 \u00a0 but we expect this to be \u2014 these conversations to be difficult.\u00a0 we expect this to be a long process.\u00a0 and we\u2019re very much at just the beginning period.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there is time, from the u.s. perspective, for these talks to continue.\u00a0 is that months?\u00a0 is that years?\u00a0 what\u2019s \u2013 you know, what are we ta- \u2014 what scale are we looking at? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i can\u2019t put a timeline on it, zeke.\u00a0 we do feel, of course, that diplomacy is the right way to approach this \u2014 this \u2014 these challenge \u2014 this challenge; that doing that in coordination and close cooperation with our partners is also exactly the right approach.\u00a0 that\u2019s what we\u2019re doing and what we\u2019re focused on now.\u00a0 \u00a0 it is a good sign and a good step that we are engaged in, even though these conversations are not direct at this point in time.\u00a0 but, again, we\u2019re at the beginning of the process.\u00a0 i expect they may have more to read out once they complete this round of talks.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and a second timetable question.\u00a0 we heard the president talk a lot about when americans will be eligible to get vaccinated.\u00a0 what is the president\u2019s timetable by which point all americans should have already been vaccinated?\u00a0 is it \u2014 what is his goal, his deadline for americans to actually get the shot in arms? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, there\u2019s a role that the federal government can play \u2014 led by the president, of course \u2014 increasing the number of vaccine supply we have.\u00a0 he\u2019s done his job in that regard.\u00a0 we\u2019re going to have enough vaccine to vaccinate \u2014 more than enough, i should say \u2014 every adult american by the end of may. \u00a0 he has increased and invested in the number of people we have as vaccinators, increased the number of vaccination sites around the country, more than doubling the number of pharmacies, investing in mass vaccination sites, investing in community health centers.\u00a0 \u00a0 it is now incumbent upon the american people to do their job and continue to mask up, get the vaccine when they\u2019re eligible.\u00a0 \u00a0 we, of course, just launched a massive public campaign that is both paid media as well as investment in community organizations, but i can\u2019t make predictions for you here.\u00a0 that is going to be determined in large part by the american public. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and so is the president\u2019s timetable of july 4th activities, gatherings in the backyard, independent from the rate of vaccination of the american public?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i think what you were asking me is when he expects \u2014 if i heard the question correctly \u2014 the vast majority of the american public to be vaccinated.\u00a0 and what i\u2019m conveying to you is that there\u2019s a role for the government to play \u2014 many roles for the government to play.\u00a0 \u00a0 we are moving forward on all of those fronts.\u00a0 but there is also a role for the american people to play, and that question will be answered in part by whether people get the vaccine when they are eligible.\u00a0 \u00a0 as it relates to july 4th barbecues, i mean, you can see the numbers that are reported regularly on vaccinations, the percentage of the public that\u2019s vaccinated, where we\u2019ve seen success in different communities; those are all numbers that are reported.\u00a0 \u00a0 what he\u2019s talking about is the ability to have a barbecue in your backyard with other people who have been vaccinated.\u00a0 that is not mass gatherings.\u00a0 that\u2019s not the same as having the entire public vaccinated.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead, jeff.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 jen, can you confirm the biden administration plans to restart aid to the palestinians?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i expect the state department is going to have more specifics on this later this afternoon or right about now, so i will leave it to them to lay out the details for you. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 we talked a little bit about taxes with the secretary.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 amazon said yesterday that it supports an increase in corporate taxes, which was interesting because the president had singled amazon out specifically.\u00a0 has the white house reached out to amazon and/or has it reached out to other companies in corporate america to try and boost support for this plan?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, we have certainly reached out to a range of groups \u2014 obviously, elected officials; large businesses; small businesses; rural and agricultural stakeholders; climate groups; local chambers of commerce; faith leaders; black, latino and aapi leaders; community college groups; and more.\u00a0 we\u2019ve done a lot of calls \u2014 a lot of zooms around here and across the administration.\u00a0 \u00a0 it\u2019s my understanding amazon did join a call with 20 other groups, carriers, and businesses as part of our outreach to a range of companies of many sizes across the country about what was being proposed and about the specifics of our proposal to pay for it.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 last one, which is a little wonky.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 a south korea company called sk innovation is threatening to pull its construction of a battery plant in georgia over a trade dispute \u2014 if you\u2019re familiar with that.\u00a0 the president has an april 11th deadline to intervene, and i\u2019m curious if he plans to.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i will probably have to take that question and talk to experts.\u00a0 i love wonky questions, but i will talk to the people who know more about it than i do. \u00a0 go ahead, kristen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 reports popped just before the briefing started that the president is going to announce a series of executive actions on guns tomorrow.\u00a0 can you confirm that?\u00a0 and anything that you can preview?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have anything to preview.\u00a0 i can convey that i expect the president will have more to say tomorrow. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and will it involve those ghost guns \u2014 potential extended background checks on ghost guns? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m just not going to preview more from here.\u00a0 i expect we\u2019ll have more \u2014 we will probably do a background briefing call for all of you later today.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 just a follow-up on something secretary raimondo said.\u00a0 she was very clear that there is room to compromise on increasing the corporate tax rate to 28 percent.\u00a0 as you know, senator manchin is saying he wants it to be as low as 25 percent.\u00a0 is there a scenario where the president would go that low?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, look, here\u2019s \u2014 here are our principles: debate is inevitable, compromise is inevitable, changes are certain, and our main bottom line is inaction is not an option.\u00a0 \u00a0 and so we see it as a positive that senator manchin, that others \u2014 republican members, other democrats \u2014 have come forward and said, \u201ci like these pieces.\u00a0 i like a different \u2014 i propose a different component on the tax piece.\u201d\u00a0 we\u2019re happy to have that discussion.\u00a0 \u00a0 and what we are seeing, though, is broad agreement about the need to invest in and modernize our infrastructure. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 could you get everything you wanted in the bill at 25 percent? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, just like any discussion or negotiation, there\u2019s lots of factors.\u00a0 it\u2019s like a rubik\u2019s cube; i don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the right analogy.\u00a0 but if you are proposing a lower tax rate, then you have to make some decisions.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what would you compromise on that?\u00a0 what would you be willing to cut? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 we\u2019re going to have \u2014 we\u2019re going to have those discussions with members of congress.\u00a0 expect the president will welcome members of both parties here when they return next week, and he\u2019ll have those discussions with them.\u00a0 we\u2019re having them with committee staffers, with staffers on the hill, to see what the push and pull can be.\u00a0 \u00a0 where there is agreement, let\u2019s start there.\u00a0 where there are alternative ideas, additional ideas \u2014 remember some \u2014 some members are proposing to make the package smaller.\u00a0 some are proposing to make it larger.\u00a0 that\u2019s all a part of the discussion. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and you said yesterday, jen, \u201cthe president continues to believe\u2026 that there is a bipartisan path forward.\u201d\u00a0 is that realistic given the backlash that you\u2019ve seen so far from republicans?\u00a0 and if the president can\u2019t win over any republicans, is he staying true to that promise of ushering in a spirit of bipartisanship? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well here\u2019s how the president sees it: democrats and republicans will have ideas about what they like or don\u2019t like about the plan.\u00a0 that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 that\u2019s democracy in action.\u00a0 that\u2019s the american way.\u00a0 \u00a0 our view \u2014 his view is we don\u2019t just fix what is broken today, we build for tomorrow.\u00a0 and his idea of infrastructure\u00a0is evolving \u2014 is that it should evolve to address the needs of the american people.\u00a0\u00a0we believe there is a fair amount of opportunity for agreement \u2014 that we are open to compromise, we welcome the debate, and we\u2019ll look forward to having those conversations when members return.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but you would pass it along party lines if you needed to? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t think we\u2019re quite there yet.\u00a0 the president believes there is an opportunity to work with democrats and republicans \u2014 that there is agreement on the need to modernize our infrastructure, there is agreement that we need to do more to compete with china.\u00a0 let\u2019s start with areas where we agree and have a discussion from there. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 two things.\u00a0 and thanks for confirming the timing on guns specifically.\u00a0 first, in a covid-related matter, there are reports that during the transition, the incoming administration received a june 2022 report from trump officials concluding that emergent biosolutions\u00a0\u2014 that plant in baltimore than spoiled some j&j vaccine doses \u2014 had oversight and quality assurance issues.\u00a0 is that accurate?\u00a0 and if you guys had this report before taking office, why were steps not taken sooner regarding that facility? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, first let me say that the facility is not approved by the fda.\u00a0 that\u2019s, in fact, the process working, in that the fda is taking a look at whether any manufacturing facility meets the standards that would be required to produce and put out doses that will go into the arms of the american people.\u00a0 there are not a broad swath of options for manufacturing facilities across the country.\u00a0 \u00a0 so hhs and others can give you more specifics of what the options are that are available, but our focus is on getting vaccines produced, distributed, in the arms of the american people, and to relying on the process that is in place by the united states government.\u00a0 \u00a0 we have one of the most stringent set of review processes in the world.\u00a0 so, in our view, this is the process working.\u00a0 we remain on track to have the number of doses \u2014 enough doses to vaccinate the entire \u2014 all adult americans by the end of may.\u00a0 this has not impacted that. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i don\u2019t hear you though confirming or denying that report? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019d have to check on the specifics of the receipt of a report.\u00a0 but, again, it was \u2014 it\u2019s still not approved by the fda \u2014 the manufacturing facility and the site.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, amnesty international says that aleksey navalny is being incarcerated in conditions that amount to torture and may be slowly killing him.\u00a0 is there any reaction from here regarding that? \u00a0 \u00a0 also, you said on february 23rd \u2014 i think you said it a few times since \u2014 that it would \u201cbe weeks, not months\u201d before the biden administration responded to the solarwinds hack, and other russian misconduct.\u00a0 i also recall you telling us some of it would be seen, some of it would not. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 mm-hmm. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 any updates on all that?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 \u201cweeks\u201d \u2014 there\u2019s lots of ways to define it.\u00a0 it\u2019s still weeks.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there are lots of ways (inaudible). \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 it is still \u2014 it is still weeks, not months away.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have an update on the exact timeline. \u00a0 i will say, on the reports you referenced of mr. navalny, we are disturbed by reports that mr. navalny\u2019s health is worsening, that he is on a hunger strike to demand \u2014 demand access to outside medical care.\u00a0 we urge russian authorities to take all necessary actions to ensure his safety and health.\u00a0 so long as he is in prison, the russian government is responsible for his health and wellbeing.\u00a0 we will continue to mon- \u2014 monitor the situation closely.\u00a0 \u00a0 i would also reiterate that we consider mr. navalny\u2019s\u00a0imprisonment on trumped-up charges to be politically motivated and a gross injustice.\u00a0 and we stand with like-minded allies and partners in calling for his immediate release, as well as an end to the persecution of his supporters.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 quick one on senator coons\u2019s comments from this morning.\u00a0 he also said today that if it\u2019s clear by memorial day that republicans aren\u2019t willing to get on board with this, that, at that point, democrats perhaps just roll this into a big package and move on.\u00a0 \u00a0 so, is that the timeline for this white house as well?\u00a0 that memorial day is the decision \u2014 the deadline to sort of make this decision to fish or cut bait? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m not here to set a new deadline from here.\u00a0 we would like to see progress by memorial day.\u00a0 we would like to see the bill passed this summer, in order to get this \u2014 these vital investments out into our economy and out into, you know, rebuilding our infrastructure across the country.\u00a0 \u00a0 i will note that there are a range of points of view, as i said in response to kristen\u2019s question.\u00a0 some feel this package should be smaller, some are calling for a larger package, some believe that it should be paid for in different ways. \u00a0 senator coons is one of \u2014 one of those individuals who will certainly have a role to play in having these discussions, but it\u2019s important that we allow the process to play itself out, have those ideas put forward, have debates, have those discussions, and we\u2019ll see where we go from there. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i have a couple of questions on immigration, if i may.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is the administration considering restarting some construction on the border wall to plug in holes in gaps of areas where the construction \u2014 construction stopped after the president took office? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, wall construction remains paused.\u00a0 there is a review in underway taking a look at the funds that had been allocated.\u00a0 \u00a0 when the administration took office, as you know \u2014 but funds had been diverted from military construction projects and other purposes toward building the wall.\u00a0 that was not something we, of course, supported.\u00a0 there are some components of the wall that had already been allocated \u2014 the funding to continue building by congress.\u00a0 so we\u2019re working within what is allowable.\u00a0 \u00a0 but our focus is not \u2014 we don\u2019t believe the wall is an answer.\u00a0 we have never believed the wall as an answer to addressing the challenges \u2014 immigration challenges at the border.\u00a0 that\u2019s why we\u2019re proposing an investment in smart \u2013investments in smart security at the border, why we\u2019re driving 20 \u2014 what we see as 21st century solutions for border management, and why we believe we should build a functioning immigration system. \u00a0 there\u2019s a review underway of, kind of, where this funding had been allocated and not, but it\u2019s currently paused and \u2014 for the most part. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but the president had said he wouldn\u2019t build one more foot of the wall, but you\u2019re saying some monies could still be used to fill in the gaps on construction on the wall? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 no, i\u2019m saying that some had been allocated already, previously.\u00a0 we\u2019re working within what our limitations are by law.\u00a0 but we believe \u2014 we \u2014 we have never believed that putting \u2014 building more of a wall \u2014 the president doesn\u2019t believe \u2014 is a way to address our immigration challenges at the border. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 okay.\u00a0 and then a quick clarification on special envoy to the northern triangle ricardo zu\u00f1iga, who is in guatemala right \u2014 was there yesterday talking about this.\u00a0 he said, \u201cthe white house is looking to create legal ways for central american migrants to reach the\u2026 u.s.\u201d\u00a0 is that what \u2014 could you explain more on, if you know, what he was talking about?\u00a0 is that what president biden has said \u2014 has talked about allowing folks to apply for asylum in their home countries?\u00a0 or is \u2014 are there other options being considered? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, the \u2014 more immediately, we\u2019ve reinstituted the central american minors program, which i would \u2014 i would think he is likely referring to \u2014 which, when it was stopped in 2017, there were about 3,000 kids who could have applied.\u00a0 i don\u2019t have an updated number on how many might be eligible now.\u00a0 that\u2019s one piece: so that kids can apply from country and won\u2019t take the treacherous journey. \u00a0 but we also believe that there needs to be reforms to the whole process: make it more efficient, more effective, in terms \u2014 when families, when children come to the border.\u00a0 that\u2019s part of what we want to disgruss [sic] \u2014 discuss through legislation.\u00a0 so he could have also been referring more broadly to the longer-term changes that need to take place.\u00a0 \u00a0 but more immediately, there, of course, is the central american minors program.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead, mario. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks, jen.\u00a0 the uk variant of the virus is now the most common in the u.s.\u00a0 we\u2019re seeing things like outbreaks in high school sports.\u00a0 does the white house consider that to be more dangerous for schools and kids?\u00a0 and also, what does that mean for the goal of reopening schools? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, in terms of the impact of the variant, i would refer to our health and medical experts to give their assessment of that. \u00a0 we remain focused on and committed to our objective of reopening schools five days a week and having kids in school, learning.\u00a0 we believe that the mitigation steps that have been put out by the cdc give a good guideline for doing exactly that.\u00a0 \u00a0 there was actually some data that was put out that is a little outdated, as these things sometimes go \u2014 because it\u2019s more from february \u2014 that showed that we are close to, even at the end of february, reading [sic] \u2014 reaching that mark of 50 percent of schools open five days a week. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, kind of similar to that, we\u2019re seeing people, who work in the retail industry, increasingly afraid for their lives, their health and safety, as customers refuse to mask up.\u00a0 what\u2019s the white house looking to do to protect them?\u00a0 are you looking at revisiting, you know, legal authority for a national mask mandate?\u00a0 i mean, what\u2019s, kind of, in the toolbox there to help these workers? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, first, i would say one of the steps we can take from the federal government is ensuring there is vaccine supply available across the country to ensure americans are vaccinated; that these individual workers, that these employees in these businesses, in stores, every one of them will be eligible on april 19th to get a vaccine. \u00a0that is, they will get \u2014 be able to get in line at that point in time.\u00a0 that provides clarity and hopefully it provides some certainty on their own safety.\u00a0 \u00a0 we also, of course, work with businesses and convey directly to businesses, just as we do to leaders across the country, about the importance of abiding by public health guidelines, and whether that is ensuring that masking up, hand washing, are seen \u2014 are used as models in these locations.\u00a0 you know, these are also entities and businesses that we\u2019re in touch with around the country as well. \u00a0 go ahead, ayesha.\u00a0 this is your first time in the briefing room \u2014 right? \u2014\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 this is my first time. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 \u2014 since the biden administration. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 yes, since the biden administration. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes.\u00a0 yes.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and it\u2019s my wedding anniversary, so it\u2019s (inaudible). \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 oh, happy anniversary.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 and here you are with us.\u00a0 (laughter.)\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and here i am with you guys. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 ed brought you a cake.\u00a0 that was so nice of ed. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i know you\u2019ll allow me a lot of questions (inaudible). \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0\u00a0 yeah.\u00a0 yeah, of course. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so, starting off on the issue of north korea: think tanks like beyond parallel and other north korea watchers have observed yesterday that north korea moved a submersible missile test stand barge.\u00a0 and along with that, there has been activity at other sites, related to weapons, in north korea.\u00a0 is the administration concerned that north korea may be ramping up for more testing, more provocative actions?\u00a0 and if so, what would be the response to that? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019ve seen those reports.\u00a0 i would send you to the department of defense.\u00a0 i\u2019m just not going to be able to get into more details from here. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 is there \u2014 with sanctions already in place \u2014 very heavy sanctions already in place on north korea \u2014 is the u.s. limited in how it could respond to potential provocations from north korea? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 you know, again, i would send you to the department of defense for that if you\u2019re asking about specifically military action or military considerations.\u00a0 \u00a0 i would say, broadly speaking, we have a clear objective as it relates to north korea, which is denuclearizing the north korean peninsula \u2014 the korean peninsula, i should say.\u00a0 we\u2019re, of course, continuing to enforce sanctions.\u00a0 we\u2019re consulting with allies and partners.\u00a0 we are prepared to consider some form of diplomacy if it\u2019s going to lead us down the path toward denuclearization.\u00a0 \u00a0 so that is broadly how we view.\u00a0 there\u2019s also a review that\u2019s underway within the administration.\u00a0 but on the specific reports, there\u2019s just not more i\u2019m going to be able to convey from here. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on a separate issue, president biden, when he was a candidate, pledged that within the first 100 days, there would be a commission on policing oversight set up.\u00a0 i know that we still have some more time in the first 100 days, but what is the status of that?\u00a0 and, you know, where do things stand with that commission?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have an update on the commission, but i would convey to you that from our consultation with congress, with the groups, our focus right now is on the george floyd justice in policing act.\u00a0 we believe we must continue to press ahead to pass meaningful police reform.\u00a0 \u00a0 the president would love to sign a piece of legislation; would love to have it on his desk.\u00a0 we\u2019re encouraged by some of the engagement we\u2019ve seen \u2014 pleasantly surprised in some cases with \u2014 in the senate.\u00a0 and that is where we feel we can have the most impact at this point in time. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so is the commission still on the table, or is that something that is not being thought of right now? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i just don\u2019t have an update on it.\u00a0 but we are focused on working with members, with advocates on many sides of this debate on how to move things forward, and we feel the george floyd justice in policing act is the most constructive, effective, impactful way to do that. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and just really quickly, the president is talking more openly about sharing vaccines with the rest of the world.\u00a0 why is that?\u00a0 and how soon does he think that the u.s. will be at a point where he feels confident sharing more of the vaccines \u2014 vaccine doses with the rest of the world? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i would say that our focus remains \u2014 his focus remains on ensuring that adult americans are vaccinated.\u00a0 we also plan for contingencies, including the fact that there\u2019s ongoing research.\u00a0 we\u2019ve seen some reporting, of course, on which vaccine is most effective with children.\u00a0 as we\u2019ve seen in the rece- \u2014 even in recent weeks, things happen and we have to plan for contingencies as well.\u00a0 \u00a0 but when we are confident about our supply, about our ability to provide for the american public, the president is absolutely committed to playing a constructive role in being a part of the global community\u2019s efforts to get the pandemic under control.\u00a0 that includes through covax.\u00a0 it also can \u2014 it could include direct conversations with countries.\u00a0 you\u2019ve seen we\u2019ve already lent doses to canada and mexico.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we remain committed to that.\u00a0 i can\u2019t give you an additional timeline at this point in time. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 back to immigration and particularly the northern triangle.\u00a0 the vice president\u2019s assignment to try to, you know, address the root causes of migration, what \u2014 how do you get a measure of success? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 how do we measure success?\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 on that issue, yeah. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i think that we know that addressing the root causes means working with these countries to help create a collaborative and a cooperative approach to addressing what the circumstances are on the ground, whether that is economic challenges, a response to challenges related to hurricanes that have impacted a lot of these communities.\u00a0 \u00a0 and what we\u2019re trying to do is work with them to determine how we can get to these root causes to reduce \u2014 to disincentivize travel from the region. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but, i mean, will you have a numerical measure, any kind of tangible measure of success, benchmarks, that sort of thing? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i think as everybody who\u2019s followed this for some time knows, this is about addressing these causes over the long term.\u00a0 unless we address root causes in these countries, we are going to see the same cycle of rushes to the border year after year, as we have seen in 2014, in 2018, in 2019.\u00a0 \u00a0 so we\u2019re going to look to how we can work with these countries through diplomatic means.\u00a0 the president has also proposed $4 billion in assistance and aid through his immigration package.\u00a0 and, of course, the vice president and our diplomats will be engaged with these countries to determine how we can best help to prevent these rushes at the border in the future. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but there\u2019s no benchmark specifically, like, you know, \u201cwe curved by x or y percent over some\u2026\u201d \u2014 a timeline period? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 we\u2019re talking about how we address this over the long term and how we reduce the incentivi- \u2014 incentiviza- \u2014 disincentivize travel over the long term to the border. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and you mentioned the money. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 can you work with these governments?\u00a0 there\u2019s a \u2014 you know, one of the major issues \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 is a lack of rule of law and corruption.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah, you\u2019re absolutely right.\u00a0 and the president has talked about this as well, and the need to sometimes work with organizations, work with local groups, find ways to avoid getting the funding in the hands, in some scenarios, of corrupt governments.\u00a0 and that will certainly be part of our approach.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead.\u00a0 yeah, go ahead.\u00a0 yeah, go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 depending on what poll you look at, about half of republican men say they won\u2019t be getting the vaccine.\u00a0 experts say that a major reason that any group would be hesitant \u2014 vaccine hesitant would be because of trust.\u00a0 i think it\u2019s probably fair to say that president biden and the administration has a long way to get this, kind of \u2014 this group to trust him. \u00a0 two questions: what has the administration\u2019s research found about why this group is so entrenched in vaccine hesitancy?\u00a0 there\u2019s a lot of talk about black and brown people.\u00a0 we found that that\u2019s not exactly true; they\u2019re not more hesitant than anyone else. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and outside of the \u201cwe can do this\u201d campaign, how does the administration plan to reach this group? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, first, we recognize that the president, that all of us may not be exactly the right messengers for some of these audiences.\u00a0 and what we\u2019ve actually seen through our data and research is that it\u2019s not always famous people \u2014 and often not famous people \u2014 like the president or athletes or former elected officials who are going to reach any group who are hesitant or have concerns about the vaccine \u2014 hesitancy or safety. \u00a0 so this is the reason why a big part of our funding and our approach to our public campaign is actually for local groups and organizations.\u00a0 some of those may be civic groups, some are clergy \u2014 there\u2019s a role that clergy and different faith groups and organizations can certainly play \u2014 and some of these are just simply local doctors and medical experts who are more trusted voices in different communities. \u00a0 so what we\u2019re working to do is empower local sources, empower local authorities, medical experts, civic leaders, clergy, in some cases, to be the communicators about the effectiveness and the efficacy of the vaccine. \u00a0 i will say one of the things that is sometimes not understood, or people don\u2019t see in the data but we\u2019ve seen in the data, is that the issue \u2014 we\u2019ve seen a reduction in hesitancy as it\u2019s defined.\u00a0 and you referenced black and brown communities \u2014 certainly a reduction in hesitancy.\u00a0 \u00a0 the issue is now access.\u00a0 this is true in whether you\u2019re talking about conservative white people or you\u2019re talking about communities of color.\u00a0 it\u2019s now at the point where people are saying, \u201clook, i \u2014 i\u2019m confident in \u2014 or i feel comfortable in taking the vaccine.\u201d\u00a0 in many cases, \u201ci can\u2019t take a day off of work.\u201d\u00a0 \u201ci don\u2019t know where to go.\u201d\u00a0 \u201ci don\u2019t know what health center to go to to get the vaccine.\u201d \u00a0 so we\u2019re looking at that, and our focus is on addressing the access issue \u2014 mobile clinics \u2014 making it easier and more accessible to get the vaccine. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and you\u2019ve also said the president is being updated on the trial of derek chauvin.\u00a0 we\u2019re probably weeks away from a verdict.\u00a0 but regardless of the outcome of the trial, does the president plan to address the country upon its conclusion? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, we would never \u2014 and not that you\u2019re asking me this, but we would never, of course, prejudge the outcome.\u00a0 the president has spoken about the death of george floyd, the impact on him personally, quite a bit over the course of the last year.\u00a0 it certainly impacted his own \u2014 redoubled his commitment to addressing racial injustice in the country and throughout the government. \u00a0 i certainly would expect we\u2019d have a statement, but i\u2019m not going to get ahead of what the outcome may be or the timeline. we just don\u2019t have insight into that. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 i\u2019d like to pick up the line of questioning on immigration and the border \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 and ask you two rather quick follow-up questions about some other topics. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 you always like \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d questions.\u00a0 i don\u2019t know if they\u2019re \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 well, i\u2019m \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 answer as you will. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so on immigration and the border, as we discussed here today, vice president harris has been put in charge of addressing the root causes of the border crisis.\u00a0 last tuesday, she spoke with guatemala\u2019s president, but she hasn\u2019t visited the border or central america or spoken to the leaders of el salvador or honduras.\u00a0 \u00a0 she was traveling this week.\u00a0 took time to visit a bakery in chicago.\u00a0 i\u2019m wondering, is she still working on this?\u00a0 and can you address the perception that she\u2019s, kind of, quietly backing off while secretary mayorkas is pursuing some trump-era policies, such as potentially building new border barriers and potentially prosecuting people who illegally cross multiple times? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 there was a whole lot packed in there, so let me just see what i can do here. \u00a0 first, i would say the vice president was visiting chicago actually to talk about covid and the importance of communities getting the vaccine when it\u2019s available and accessible to them. and so, while she was there, like many americans, she got a snack.\u00a0 i think she\u2019s allowed to do that.\u00a0 \u00a0 but she was there to talk about covid and play a role \u2014 as she\u2019s playing a significant role on our efforts to address vaccine hesitancy, communicate with the public about how we can do this, and it\u2019s \u2014 it\u2019s imperative to get the vaccine once available. \u00a0 second, i would say that yesterday \u2014 and this was actually a statement put out by her team \u2014 usaid announced the deployment of a dart team \u2014 we only have these in a couple of places in the world, so this is fairly significant \u2014 to respond to urgent humanitarian needs in guatemala, honduras, and el salvador.\u00a0 this is meant to help address the immediate humanitarian needs, whether it\u2019s drought, food insecurity, ongoing covid-19 pandemic.\u00a0 and this is in communities that are still recovering.\u00a0 so that is actually an announcement made by the vice president\u2019s team earlier today. \u00a0 this is absolutely an issue that she is \u2014 remains committed to, is in the lead on.\u00a0 the northern triangle, which i\u2019m sure you\u2019re aware of, but is not the same as the border. they\u2019re all related to each other, but addressing the north- \u2014 being responsible in the lead on the northern triangle is working with these countries in the region, addressing the root causes, working with them on how we can address issues like long-term food insecurity, drought, the covid-19 pandemic, hurricanes, et cetera.\u00a0 that\u2019s what she\u2019s focused on. \u00a0 i don\u2019t have an update on when she\u2019ll travel.\u00a0 i\u2019m sure it will be soon. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 but she\u2019s still working on this issue very much? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, they wouldn\u2019t be putting out a statement this morning if she wasn\u2019t, would they? \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and my two other questions \u2014 i\u2019d like to circle back to something that a colleague asked in this room a few weeks ago.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 they asked about a request by about three dozen democrats in congress for president biden to relinquish unilateral nuclear launch authority.\u00a0 i believe, at the time, you weren\u2019t aware of that request, and i was wondering if you\u2019ve been able to get an answer from the president on that. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have anything more for you on that. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and my third question, if i could. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 according to a report yesterday in axios, we may soon have a prominent transgender gubernatorial candidate.\u00a0 it would be a republican, caitlyn jenner, in california.\u00a0 and i\u2019m not asking \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 are you announcing her run? \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 no, no.\u00a0 i\u2019m just announcing an axios report. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 are you working for her? \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i am not. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 okay. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i\u2019m not.\u00a0 but \u2014 and i\u2019m not asking you to endorse anyone, but i was wondering if the white house welcomes this appearance, a lgbt milestone. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 we certainly would welcome the freedom of any \u2014 any human be participating in the democratic process to run for office, of course, and including, of course, transgender members of our society. \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 i just want to ask if the budget rollout is still going to happen this week.\u00a0 and secondly, is it accurate that debate or discussion about defense spending is what\u2019s holding it up? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 that is not accurate.\u00a0 we know you all are eager to have the discretionary guidance, and it certainly will give some insight into the president\u2019s priorities and the priorities of this administration.\u00a0 we hope to have that out very soon this week, but i don\u2019t have an exact date for you quite yet. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 it sounds like it could possibly slip into next week.\u00a0 is that \u2014 is that (inaudible)? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think we\u2019re hopeful it will be out this week. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, just to follow up on the olympics issue: understanding what you said, the u.s. position, however, is still that china has committed genocide. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yes. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 doesn\u2019t that demand some sort of response or action from the u.s.?\u00a0 and what will the u.s. need to see before it fully participates in the olympics? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i would say, first, just to be very clear and reiterate: our position has not changed in our planned participation.\u00a0 however, we are working, of course, on \u2014 as we would be on any issue, in coordination with our partners and allies about a range of concerns we have with china\u2019s behavior and their actions, including the genocide of uighur muslims in china, including actions that china has taken as it relates to economic and security steps.\u00a0 \u00a0 and so that is something we would do in partnership and coordination with our partners in the region.\u00a0 just like any relationship, there are areas where we feel we can work together; areas where we have great concerns. \u00a0we voice those.\u00a0 we don\u2019t hold back on those as the president did in his call with the president.\u00a0 \u00a0 go ahead. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 there\u2019s \u2014 i have a couple questions.\u00a0 the first is, there are some studies that show that black americans have half of the vaccination rate of white americans, and i wonder why the administration is not setting hard numbers with their equity goals.\u00a0 how do you measure success if you don\u2019t put actual numbers next to the goals? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i would have to check those numbers.\u00a0 i\u2019m not challenging them, i just would have to talk to our covid team about those.\u00a0 as you know, equity is central to what we do \u2014 covid and addressing the pandemic.\u00a0 and ensuring we are taking steps to address getting the vaccine out to communities around the country is central to our focus. \u00a0 we are constantly monitoring where the vaccine doses are going and that they\u2019re equitably distributed.\u00a0 that\u2019s something \u2014 every vaccine is marked in boxes.\u00a0 it\u2019s \u2014 we saw this at pfizer.\u00a0 it\u2019s very cool actually.\u00a0 we monitor that closely. \u00a0 we monitor the uptick in outbreak and covid rates in communities and see how it\u2019s being \u2014 how it\u2019s impacting different communities.\u00a0 we work directly with governors to help address where there are upticks in communities and where we see there are communities that are not getting ready access to the vaccine.\u00a0 \u00a0 and we\u2019ve actually adjusted, in some cases, our approach and our strategy.\u00a0 that\u2019s why we\u2019ve increased our investment in community health centers massively over the course of the last several weeks; why we\u2019ve increased our investment in mobile clinics.\u00a0 because one of the issues we\u2019re seeing is access.\u00a0 right?\u00a0 access and the ability to \u2014 many people can\u2019t take a day off of work, especially if they\u2019re working in jobs where it doesn\u2019t allow for that.\u00a0 we want to bring the vaccine to people as frequently as we can.\u00a0 \u00a0 so what i would tell you is that we are constantly adapting and adjusting our strategy to areas where we see that we are not effectively addressing distributing the vaccine equitably.\u00a0 that is central to our focus and will continue to be. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just to reiterate, the question was: why not set hard numbers?\u00a0 there\u2019s 100 million for the first 100 days, then 200 million.\u00a0 why not say, \u201cwe want to see 20 percent or 30 percent of black people, hispanics\u2026\u201d?\u00a0 why not put numbers by your equity goals?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019m happy to check with our team.\u00a0 we may have internal goals along those lines, but i would just convey to you that we look at it as our objective is to vaccinate every adult american.\u00a0 that includes, of course, every adult american who is white, black, brown, asian american \u2014 and that we look closely at where we are \u2014 where there are communities where there is an uptick, where there are communities \u2014 \u00a0 so i was trying to actually address your question on actually what we\u2019re doing about it, which i think is the most important information people might be looking for.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then, related to racial equality, the infrastructure bill has $400 billion focused on home healthcare aides \u2014 a lot of them are women, women of color.\u00a0 how is that infrastructure?\u00a0 explain why you see home healthcare workers as part of infrastructure.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, first, this is essentially a jobs bill.\u00a0 yes, there\u2019s a lot in here that is infrastructure.\u00a0 but as the secretary just conveyed, our workers, our workforce is part of the backbone and the infrastructure of america\u2019s economy and communities.\u00a0 \u00a0 and if you have home health workers, as you noted, who are predominantly women of color; they are predominantly workers who are paid often $11 an hour, about, on average \u2014 these are communities and individuals who need greater assistance and need greater help.\u00a0 \u00a0 in addition, the people who are impacted most by the need for caregiving are women.\u00a0 we see that statistically: about 2 million women have left the workforce as a result of the pandemic.\u00a0 \u00a0 and so, our objective and our focus is on addressing physical infrastructure, the infrastructure that is going to help us compete, including broadband.\u00a0 \u00a0 i had \u2014 oh, here.\u00a0 this is a broadband map.\u00a0 i love maps.\u00a0 don\u2019t you guys?\u00a0 this shows where there is not great broadband around the country, which i think is so interesting and shows you how much we need to do \u2014 what we need to do to address it.\u00a0 \u00a0 but if we\u2019re going to get women back in the workforce, this is an area where we need to address.\u00a0 and so the president felt it was an important and imperative part of the package.\u00a0 and as the secretary noted, it\u2019s something that many businesses are also welcoming.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 if i could add two quick questions that are very \u2014 one is a yes-or-no question.\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 president biden has indicated that beau biden\u2019s cancer was likely caused or linked to burn pits.\u00a0 this is a question from our foreign team: does president biden and the white house support the bill senator gillibrand and senator rubio have sponsored related to burn pits?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i\u2019ll have to look more specifically at the bill.\u00a0 he has talked about this quite frequently, including when we were in \u2014 i can\u2019t remember what state, where he visited the hospital \u2014 i don\u2019t remember.\u00a0 \u00a0 aide:\u00a0 ohio. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 ohio.\u00a0 thanks.\u00a0 it\u2019s like a phone-a-friend.\u00a0 when we were in ohio, he talked about this as well.\u00a0 but i can check with our legislative team. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 (inaudible) if he supports the bill? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i haven\u2019t looked more deeply into the specifics of the bill. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and then my last question is on immigration.\u00a0 the family reunification task force, as of now, is saying that it hasn\u2019t reunanified [sic] \u2014 it hasn\u2019t reunited any families because they\u2019re still sorting through the system.\u00a0 \u00a0 i wonder, can you talk a bit about why they haven\u2019t been able to reunite families, and what are the concerns and challenges that maybe are even more \u2014 even more pronounced than you would have thought they were going to be? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 sure.\u00a0 first, we can\u2019t overstate how complex this challenge is.\u00a0 the prior administration did not have a system in place to track the children and parents who were separated.\u00a0 they also, of course, separated them themselves.\u00a0 \u00a0 but the task force has been in place, as you know, for about two months.\u00a0 the focus right now, in this period of time, has been reviewing thousands of records, and a significant number of issues have come up in these existing files, including incorrect dates and names.\u00a0 \u00a0 we\u2019re working \u2014 they are working to establish a database of families who were separated and working to find previously unidentified separated families who are eligible to receive benefits through the task force.\u00a0 and they\u2019ve also identified over 5,600 new files that were not reviewed and have begun the process for reviewing and crosschecking those files. \u00a0 the task force is also working very closely with the aclu to process identified families so we can reunite them as swiftly as possible.\u00a0 they\u2019ll have a full report; that\u2019s due on june 2nd. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 so you\u2019re saying \u2014 but what\u2019s the delay in it being so \u2014 what\u2019s \u2014 what makes it so hard to reunite families while they\u2019re doing that?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 well, i think the biggest challenge is that there\u2019s a lot of inaccurate information.\u00a0 there wasn\u2019t accurate \u2014 there was not an accurate database.\u00a0 we\u2019ve seen inaccurate names, inaccurate dates.\u00a0 \u00a0 again, we\u2019re working very closely with the aclu, and we\u2019re working to move it as quickly as possible.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 go ahead, in the back. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen.\u00a0 you said earlier that the white house recognizes that some of you may not always be the right messenger to some of these individuals who are reluctant to take the president\u2019s \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 advice on getting vaccinated.\u00a0 \u00a0 the president said yesterday there was a category he didn\u2019t exactly identify, but he gave senator mcconnell credit for talking to those people.\u00a0 did the president ask his friend, senator mcconnell, to help him out on trying to make a pitch to those people who are not \u2014 who are reluctant to follow the president\u2019s lead on this?\u00a0\u00a0 and has he asked other republican pals of his to do the same to help out?\u00a0 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any calls to read out or asks from the president, but i would just reiterate: we certainly do think it\u2019s a good step that senator mcconnell conveyed the importance and the efficacy of taking the vaccine. \u00a0 but also, across the board, all of our data shows that the most effective voices are local doctors, civic leaders, clergy, others who are trusted in communities.\u00a0 and that\u2019s really where our primary focus and the president\u2019s primary focus is. \u00a0 so, one in the back. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 will president biden appoint a special envoy for the israeli-palestinian portfolio?\u00a0 if so, when?\u00a0 and if not, why? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any personnel announcements to make here.\u00a0 of course, the president believes that the only \u2014 the most \u2014 the only solution is a two-state solution, but i don\u2019t have any personnel or specifics to outline for you from here in addition.\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 just real \u2014 one quick thing \u2014 \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 yeah. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u2014 that happened here while we were sitting here.\u00a0 i don\u2019t know if you guys have this yet or not, that \u2014 apparently, the president called king abdullah of jordan. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 mm-hmm. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 can you \u2014 have we \u2014 have you guys confirmed that yet or no? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i think it\u2019s been happening \u2014 it sounds like \u2014 as we\u2019ve \u2014 here.\u00a0 we\u2019ll have a robust readout, and we\u2019ll get that out to all of you guys. \u00a0 go ahead, kristen. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thanks.\u00a0 jen, has the president seen the video of the boy who came here from nicaragua, abandoned, alone, crying to border patrol agents?\u00a0 if so, what was his response? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any response from the president directly.\u00a0 what i can convey is: for any of us who have seen that video, it is heartbreaking.\u00a0 it\u2019s a reminder of how treacherous the journey is.\u00a0 and it is a reminder of how important and impera- \u2014 imperative it is that we put in place reforms to our immigration system; that we convey clearly how dangerous this journey is; and that we take steps \u2014 like the central american minors program \u2014 to make it possible to apply from within the country. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 and given what\u2019s happening at the border, why hasn\u2019t the president \u2014 why hasn\u2019t the vice president visited yet? \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 visited the border?\u00a0 \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 the border, yes. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 i don\u2019t have any trips to outline or preview.\u00a0 what our focus is on is solutions \u2014 and ensuring we have more beds, we\u2019re making the processing more efficient and effective, and that we are addressing this in a humane way that keeps these kids as safe as we possibly can. \u00a0 q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 thank you, jen. \u00a0 ms. psaki:\u00a0 thanks, everyone. \u00a0 1:36 p.m. edt"},

{"header": "\n\t\t\t\t\t\t\tinaugural address by president joseph r. biden, jr.\t\t\t\t\t\t", "date": "january 20, 2021", "text": "the united states capitol 11:52 am est the president: chief justice roberts, vice president harris, speaker pelosi, leader schumer, leader mcconnell, vice president pence, distinguished guests, and my fellow americans. this is america\u2019s day. this is democracy\u2019s day. a day of history and hope. of renewal and resolve. through a crucible for the ages america has been tested anew and america has risen to the challenge. today, we celebrate the triumph not of a candidate, but of a cause, the cause of democracy. the will of the people has been heard and the will of the people has been heeded. we have learned again that democracy is precious. democracy is fragile. and at this hour, my friends, democracy has prevailed. so now, on this hallowed ground where just days ago violence sought to shake this capitol\u2019s very foundation, we come together as one nation, under god, indivisible, to carry out the peaceful transfer of power as we have for more than two centuries. we look ahead in our uniquely american way \u2013 restless, bold, optimistic \u2013 and set our sights on the nation we know we can be and we must be. i thank my predecessors of both parties for their presence here. i thank them from the bottom of my heart. you know the resilience of our constitution and the strength of our nation. as does president carter, who i spoke to last night but who cannot be with us today, but whom we salute for his lifetime of service. i have just taken the sacred oath each of these patriots took \u2014 an oath first sworn by george washington. but the american story depends not on any one of us, not on some of us, but on all of us. on \u201cwe the people\u201d who seek a more perfect union. this is a great nation and we are a good people. over the centuries through storm and strife, in peace and in war, we have come so far. but we still have far to go. we will press forward with speed and urgency, for we have much to do in this winter of peril and possibility. much to repair. much to restore. much to heal. much to build. and much to gain. few periods in our nation\u2019s history have been more challenging or difficult than the one we\u2019re in now. a once-in-a-century virus silently stalks the country. it\u2019s taken as many lives in one year as america lost in all of world war ii. millions of jobs have been lost. hundreds of thousands of businesses closed. a cry for racial justice some 400 years in the making moves us. the dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer. a cry for survival comes from the planet itself. a cry that can\u2019t be any more desperate or any more clear. and now, a rise in political extremism, white supremacy, domestic terrorism that we must confront and we will defeat. to overcome these challenges \u2013 to restore the soul and to secure the future of america \u2013 requires more than words. it requires that most elusive of things in a democracy: unity. unity. in another january in washington, on new year\u2019s day 1863, abraham lincoln signed the emancipation proclamation. when he put pen to paper, the president said, \u201cif my name ever goes down into history it will be for this act and my whole soul is in it.\u201d my whole soul is in it. today, on this january day, my whole soul is in this: bringing america together. uniting our people. and uniting our nation. i ask every american to join me in this cause. uniting to fight the common foes we face: anger, resentment, hatred. extremism, lawlessness, violence. disease, joblessness, hopelessness. with unity we can do great things. important things. we can right wrongs. we can put people to work in good jobs. we can teach our children in safe schools. we can overcome this deadly virus. we can reward work, rebuild the middle class, and make health care secure for all. we can deliver racial justice. we can make america, once again, the leading force for good in the world. i know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy. i know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. but i also know they are not new. our history has been a constant struggle between the american ideal that we are all created equal and the harsh, ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, and demonization have long torn us apart. the battle is perennial. victory is never assured. through the civil war, the great depression, world war, 9/11, through struggle, sacrifice, and setbacks, our \u201cbetter angels\u201d have always prevailed. in each of these moments, enough of us came together to carry all of us forward. and, we can do so now. history, faith, and reason show the way, the way of unity. we can see each other not as adversaries but as neighbors. we can treat each other with dignity and respect. we can join forces, stop the shouting, and lower the temperature. for without unity, there is no peace, only bitterness and fury. no progress, only exhausting outrage. no nation, only a state of chaos. this is our historic moment of crisis and challenge, and unity is the path forward. and, we must meet this moment as the united states of america. if we do that, i guarantee you, we will not fail. we have never, ever, ever failed in america when we have acted together. and so today, at this time and in this place, let us start afresh. all of us. let us listen to one another. hear one another. see one another. show respect to one another. politics need not be a raging fire destroying everything in its path. every disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war. and, we must reject a culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured. my fellow americans, we have to be different than this. america has to be better than this. and, i believe america is better than this. just look around. here we stand, in the shadow of a capitol dome that was completed amid the civil war, when the union itself hung in the balance. yet we endured and we prevailed. here we stand looking out to the great mall where dr. king spoke of his dream. here we stand, where 108 years ago at another inaugural, thousands of protestors tried to block brave women from marching for the right to vote. today, we mark the swearing-in of the first woman in american history elected to national office \u2013 vice president kamala harris. don\u2019t tell me things can\u2019t change. here we stand across the potomac from arlington national cemetery, where heroes who gave the last full measure of devotion rest in eternal peace. and here we stand, just days after a riotous mob thought they could use violence to silence the will of the people, to stop the work of our democracy, and to drive us from this sacred ground. that did not happen. it will never happen. not today. not tomorrow. not ever. to all those who supported our campaign i am humbled by the faith you have placed in us. to all those who did not support us, let me say this: hear me out as we move forward. take a measure of me and my heart. and if you still disagree, so be it. that\u2019s democracy. that\u2019s america. the right to dissent peaceably, within the guardrails of our republic, is perhaps our nation\u2019s greatest strength. yet hear me clearly: disagreement must not lead to disunion. and i pledge this to you: i will be a president for all americans. i will fight as hard for those who did not support me as for those who did. many centuries ago, saint augustine, a saint of my church, wrote that a people was a multitude defined by the common objects of their love. what are the common objects we love that define us as americans? i think i know. opportunity. security. liberty. dignity. respect. honor. and, yes, the truth. recent weeks and months have taught us a painful lesson. there is truth and there are lies. lies told for power and for profit. and each of us has a duty and responsibility, as citizens, as americans, and especially as leaders \u2013 leaders who have pledged to honor our constitution and protect our nation \u2014 to defend the truth and to defeat the lies. i understand that many americans view the future with some fear and trepidation. i understand they worry about their jobs, about taking care of their families, about what comes next. i get it. but the answer is not to turn inward, to retreat into competing factions, distrusting those who don\u2019t look like you do, or worship the way you do, or don\u2019t get their news from the same sources you do. we must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue, rural versus urban, conservative versus liberal. we can do this if we open our souls instead of hardening our hearts. if we show a little tolerance and humility. if we\u2019re willing to stand in the other person\u2019s shoes just for a moment. because here is the thing about life: there is no accounting for what fate will deal you. there are some days when we need a hand. there are other days when we\u2019re called on to lend one. that is how we must be with one another. and, if we are this way, our country will be stronger, more prosperous, more ready for the future. my fellow americans, in the work ahead of us, we will need each other. we will need all our strength to persevere through this dark winter. we are entering what may well be the toughest and deadliest period of the virus. we must set aside the politics and finally face this pandemic as one nation. i promise you this: as the bible says weeping may endure for a night but joy cometh in the morning. we will get through this, together the world is watching today. so here is my message to those beyond our borders: america has been tested and we have come out stronger for it. we will repair our alliances and engage with the world once again. not to meet yesterday\u2019s challenges, but today\u2019s and tomorrow\u2019s. we will lead not merely by the example of our power but by the power of our example. we will be a strong and trusted partner for peace, progress, and security. we have been through so much in this nation. and, in my first act as president, i would like to ask you to join me in a moment of silent prayer to remember all those we lost this past year to the pandemic. to those 400,000 fellow americans \u2013 mothers and fathers, husbands and wives, sons and daughters, friends, neighbors, and co-workers. we will honor them by becoming the people and nation we know we can and should be. let us say a silent prayer for those who lost their lives, for those they left behind, and for our country. amen. this is a time of testing. we face an attack on democracy and on truth. a raging virus. growing inequity. the sting of systemic racism. a climate in crisis. america\u2019s role in the world. any one of these would be enough to challenge us in profound ways. but the fact is we face them all at once, presenting this nation with the gravest of responsibilities. now we must step up. all of us. it is a time for boldness, for there is so much to do. and, this is certain. we will be judged, you and i, for how we resolve the cascading crises of our era. will we rise to the occasion? will we master this rare and difficult hour? will we meet our obligations and pass along a new and better world for our children? i believe we must and i believe we will. and when we do, we will write the next chapter in the american story. it\u2019s a story that might sound something like a song that means a lot to me. it\u2019s called \u201camerican anthem\u201d and there is one verse stands out for me: \u201cthe work and prayers of centuries have brought us to this day what shall be our legacy? what will our children say?\u2026 let me know in my heart when my days are through america america i gave my best to you.\u201d let us add our own work and prayers to the unfolding story of our nation. if we do this then when our days are through our children and our children\u2019s children will say of us they gave their best. they did their duty. they healed a broken land. my fellow americans, i close today where i began, with a sacred oath. before god and all of you i give you my word. i will always level with you. i will defend the constitution. i will defend our democracy. i will defend america. i will give my all in your service thinking not of power, but of possibilities. not of personal interest, but of the public good. and together, we shall write an american story of hope, not fear. of unity, not division. of light, not darkness. an american story of decency and dignity. of love and of healing. of greatness and of goodness. may this be the story that guides us. the story that inspires us. the story that tells ages yet to come that we answered the call of history. we met the moment. that democracy and hope, truth and justice, did not die on our watch but thrived. that our america secured liberty at home and stood once again as a beacon to the world. that is what we owe our forebearers, one another, and generations to follow. so, with purpose and resolve we turn to the tasks of our time. sustained by faith. driven by conviction. and, devoted to one another and to this country we love with all our hearts. may god bless america and may god protect our troops. thank you, america. end 12:13 pm est"},

asterisk. the president:\u00a0 thank you, kamala \u2014 madam vice president.\u00a0 thank you very much.\u00a0 \u00a0 you know, we\u2019re joined today by the attorney general, merrick garland, who i\u2019ve asked to prioritize gun violence.\u00a0 it\u2019s also good to see the second gentleman, who is here.\u00a0 and it\u2019s good to see the first lady, dr. jill biden, who cares deeply about this issue as well.\u00a0 \u00a0 and i look out there and i see so many members of congress who have led in this fight.\u00a0 so many of you who have never given up.\u00a0 so many of you who are in \u2014 absolutely determined, as murph and others are, to get this done.\u00a0 \u00a0 we got a long way to go.\u00a0 it always seems like we always have a long way to go.\u00a0 but i also \u2014 today, we\u2019re taking steps to confront not just the gun crisis, but what is actually a public health crisis.\u00a0 nothing \u2014 nothing i\u2019m about to recommend in any way impinges on the second amendment.\u00a0 they\u2019re phony, arguments suggesting that these are second amendment rights at stake from what we\u2019re talking about.\u00a0 \u00a0 but no amendment \u2014 no amendment to the constitution is absolute.\u00a0 you can\u2019t yell crowd \u2014 you can\u2019t  tell  [yell]* \u201cfire\u201d in a crowded movie theater and call it freedom of speech.\u00a0 from the very beginning, you couldn\u2019t own any weapon you wanted to own.\u00a0 from the very beginning that the second amendment existed, certain people weren\u2019t allowed to have weapons.\u00a0 so the idea is just bizarre to suggest that some of the things we\u2019re recommending are contrary to the constitution.\u00a0 \u00a0 gun violence in this country is an epidemic.\u00a0 let me say it again: gun violence in this country is an epidemic, and it\u2019s an international embarrassment.\u00a0 (applause.)\u00a0 \u00a0 you know, we saw that again.\u00a0 last night, as i was coming to the oval office, i got the word that, in south carolina, a physician with his wife, two grandchildren, and a person working at his house was gunned down \u2014 all five.\u00a0 so many people \u2014 so many of the people sitting here today know that well, unfortunately.\u00a0 you know, they know what it\u2019s like when the seconds change your life forever.\u00a0 \u00a0 i have had the \u2014 the pleasure of getting to meet, in awful circumstances, many of you \u2014 many of you who\u2019ve lost your children, your husbands, your wives.\u00a0 you know, they know what it\u2019s like to bury a piece of their soul deep in the earth.\u00a0 we understand that.\u00a0 \u00a0 mark and jackie, i want to tell you: it\u2019s always good to see you, but not under these circumstances.\u00a0 \u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 i want to say, before i introduce the rest of the folks, is, you know, what \u2014 a lot of people have not been through what they\u2019ve been through \u2014 don\u2019t understand.\u00a0 it takes a lot of courage to come to an event like this.\u00a0 they\u2019re absolutely, absolutely determined to make change.\u00a0 \u00a0 but mark and jackie, whose son daniel was a first grader at sandy hook elementary school.\u00a0 daniel loved sports \u2014 loves outdoors sports, getting muddy. \u00a0 i see my friend fred guttenberg.\u00a0 his daughter, jaime, was a freshman at marjorie stoneman douglas high school.\u00a0 she was an accomplished dancer. \u00a0 i see brandon wolf, who \u2014 the shooting at the \u2014 at the impulse \u2014 at the pulse club \u2014 nightclub.\u00a0 he survived, but his two best friends died.\u00a0 \u00a0 greg jackson, who was just walking down the street when he was caught in the crossfire of a gunfight. \u00a0 and, of course, i see a close friend of jill\u2019s and mine, congresswoman gabby giffords, who is here.\u00a0 who was \u2014 who was speaking with her constituents in front a grocery store in her state when she was shot and a member of her staff was killed.\u00a0 \u00a0 you know, they\u2019re here, and their pain is immense.\u00a0 and, you know, what a lot of you \u2014 hopefully many of you \u2014 don\u2019t know is if you\u2019ve gone through a trauma, no matter how much you work to make sure others don\u2019t go through it, every time you show up at an event like this, it brings back when you got that phone call.\u00a0 it brings back the immediacy of what happened at that moment.\u00a0 \u00a0 so i genuinely mean it: thank you.\u00a0 thank you for having the courage \u2014 the courage to be here, the courage to continue this fight.\u00a0 senator blumenthal understands it.\u00a0 a lot of the folks out here understand it.\u00a0 but it takes real courage, so thank you.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \u00a0 to turn pain into purpose and demand that we take the actions that gives meaning to the word \u201cenough.\u201d\u00a0 enough.\u00a0 enough.\u00a0 enough.\u00a0 enough.\u00a0 because what they want you to know, what they want you to do is not just listen.\u00a0 \u00a0 every day in this country, 316 people are shot.\u00a0 every single day.\u00a0 a hundred and six of them die every day.\u00a0 our flag was still flying at half-staff for the victims of the horrific murder of 8 primarily asian american people in georgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass murder in colorado.\u00a0 \u00a0 you probably didn\u2019t hear it, but between those two incidents, less than one week apart, there were more than 850 additional shootings \u2014 850 \u2014 that took the lives of more than 250 people, and left 500 \u2014 500 \u2014 injured.\u00a0 this is an epidemic, for god\u2019s sake.\u00a0 and it has to stop.\u00a0 \u00a0 so i\u2019m here to talk about two things: first, the steps we\u2019re going to take immediately, and, second, the action that needs to be taken going forward to curb the epidemic of gun violence. \u00a0 i asked the attorney general and his team to identify for me immediate, concrete actions i could can take now without having to go through the congress.\u00a0\u00a0 and today, i\u2019m announcing several initial steps my administration is taking to curb this epidemic of gun violence.\u00a0 \u00a0 much more need be done, but the first \u2014 first, i want to rein in the proliferation of so-called \u201cghost guns.\u201d\u00a0\u00a0 these are guns that are homemade, built from a kit that include the directions on how to finish the firearm.\u00a0 you can go buy the kit.\u00a0 they have no serial numbers, so when they show up at a crime scene, they can\u2019t be traced.\u00a0 \u00a0 and the buyers aren\u2019t required to pass a background check to buy the kit to make the gun.\u00a0 consequently, anyone \u2014 anyone from a criminal to a terrorist can buy this kit and, in as little as 30 minutes, put together a weapon. \u00a0 you know, i want to see these kits treated as firearms under the gun control act, which is going to require that the seller and manufacturers make the key parts with serial numbers and run background checks on the buyers when they walk in to buy that package.\u00a0 \u00a0 the section [sic] action we\u2019re going to \u2014 the second action we\u2019re going to take \u2014 back in 2000 \u2014 the year 2000, the bureau of alcohol, tobacco, and firearms released a report on its investigations into firearms trafficking in america.\u00a0 the report was of pivotal value.\u00a0 it was an important tool for policymakers when i was in the senate and beyond, at all levels, to stop firearms from being illegally diverted into dangerous hands.\u00a0 \u00a0 today, with online sales and ghost guns, times and trafficking methods have changed, and we have to adjust.\u00a0 we also have to ask the justice department to release a new annual report.\u00a0 this report will better help policymakers address firearms trafficking as it is today, not what it was yesterday.\u00a0 \u00a0 a third change: we want to treat pistols modified with stabilizing braces with the seriousness they deserve.\u00a0 a stabilizing brace \u2014 you\u2019re going to (inaudible) \u2014 essentially, it makes that pistol a hell of a lot more accurate and a mini-rifle.\u00a0 as a result, it\u2019s more lethal, effectively turning into a short-barreled rifle.\u00a0 that\u2019s what the alleged shooter in boulder appears to have done. \u00a0 i want to be clear that these modifications to firearms that make them more lethal should be subject to the national firearms act.\u00a0 the national firearms act requires that a potential owner pay a $200 fee and submit their name and other identifying information to the justice department, just as they would if they went out and purchased a silencer for a gun.\u00a0 \u00a0 fourthly, during my campaign for president, i wanted to make it easier for states to adopt extreme risk protection order laws.\u00a0 they\u2019re also called \u201cred flag\u201d laws, which everybody on this lawn knows, but many people listening do not know.\u00a0 these laws allow a police or family member to petition a court in their jurisdiction and say, \u201ci want you to temporarily remove from the following people any firearm they may possess because they\u2019re a danger.\u00a0 in a crisis, they\u2019re presenting a danger to themselves and to others.\u201d\u00a0 and the court makes a ruling.\u00a0 \u00a0 to put this in perspective, more than half of all suicides, for example, involve the use of a firearm.\u00a0 but when a gun is not available, an attempt at suicide \u2014 the death rate drops precipitously. \u00a0states that have red flag laws have seen and \u2014 seen a reduction in the number of suicides in their states.\u00a0 \u00a0 every single month, by the way, an average of 53 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner.\u00a0 i wrote the violence against women act.\u00a0 it\u2019s been a constant struggle to keep it moving.\u00a0 we know red flag laws can have a significant effect in protecting women from domestic violence.\u00a0 and we know red flag laws can stop mass shooters before they can act out their violent plans.\u00a0 \u00a0 i\u2019m proud \u2014 \u201cexcuse the point of personal privilege,\u201d as we used to say in the senate \u2014 i\u2019m proud that the red flag law in my home state of delaware was named after my son, attorney general beau biden \u2014 our son; excuse me, jill \u2014 who proposed that legislation back in 2013.\u00a0 \u00a0 i want to see a national red flag law and legislation to incentivize states to enact their own red flag laws. \u00a0today, i asked the justice department to publish a model red flag legislation so states can start crafting their own laws right now.\u00a0 just like with background checks, the vast majority of americans support these extreme risk protection order laws, and it\u2019s time to put these laws on the books and protect even more people.\u00a0 the attorney general will have more to say about this in a moment.\u00a0 \u00a0 additionally, we recognize that cities across the country are experiencing historic spikes in homicides, as the law enforcement can tell you.\u00a0 the violence is hitting black and brown communities the hardest.\u00a0 homicide is the leading cause of death of black boys and men ages 15 to 34 \u2014 the leading cause of death.\u00a0 \u00a0 but there are proven strategies that reduce gun violence in urban communities, and there are programs that have demonstrated they can reduce homicides by up to 60 percent in urban communities.\u00a0 but many of these have been badly underfunded or not funded at all of late. \u00a0 gun violence in america \u2014 for those of you who think of this from an economic standpoint listening to me \u2014 estimated to cost the nation $280 billion \u2013- let me say it again \u2014 $280 billion a year.\u00a0 they said, \u201chow could that be, joe?\u201d\u00a0 hospital bills, physical therapy, trauma counseling, legal fees, prison costs, and the loss of productivity.\u00a0 not to mention the psychological damage done to the children who live in these cities, watching this happen, knowing someone it happened to.\u00a0 \u00a0 this gun violence in our neighborhood is having a profound impact on our children, even if they\u2019re never involved in pulling the trigger or being the victim of \u2014 on the other side of a trigger. \u00a0 for a fraction of the cost of gun violence, we can save lives, create safe and healthy communities, and build economies that work for all of us, and save billions of american dollars.\u00a0 \u00a0 in the meantime, much of it, as senator cicilline knows, is taxpayer money. \u00a0 finally, the bureau of alcobol [sic] \u2014 alcohol, tobacco, and firearms, the key agency enforcing gun laws, hasn\u2019t had a permanent director since 2015. \u00a0 today, i\u2019m proud to nominate david chipman to serve as the director of the aft.\u00a0 david knows the aft well.\u00a0 he served there for 25 years.\u00a0 and vice president harris and i believe he\u2019s the right person, at this moment, for this important agency. \u00a0 and i\u2019ve said before: my job, the job of any president, is to protect the american people.\u00a0 whether congress acts or not, i\u2019m going to use all the resources at my disposal as president to keep the american people safe from gun violence.\u00a0 but there\u2019s much more that congress can do to help that effort.\u00a0 and they can do it right now. \u00a0 they\u2019ve offered plenty of thoughts and prayers \u2014 members of congress \u2014 but they\u2019ve passed not a single new federal law to reduce gun violence.\u00a0 enough prayers.\u00a0 time for some action. \u00a0 i believe the senate should immediately pass three house-passed bills to close loopholes that allow gun purchases \u2014 purchasers to bypass the background checks.\u00a0 the vast majority of the american people, including gun owners, believe there should be background checks before you purchase a gun. \u00a0 as was noted earlier, hundreds of thousands of people have been denied guns because of the background checks.\u00a0 what more would have happened?\u00a0 \u00a0 these bills, one, require background checks for anyone purchasing a gun at a gun show or an online sale.\u00a0 (applause.) \u00a0 most people don\u2019t know: if you walk into a store and you buy a gun, you have a background check.\u00a0 but you go to a gun show, you can buy whatever you want and no background check. \u00a0 second thing is to close the charles- \u2014 what\u2019s known as the \u201ccharleston\u201d loophole.\u00a0 like people here, i spent time down at that church in charleston.\u00a0 what happened is someone was allowed to get the gun used to kill those innocent people at a church service.\u00a0 if the fbi hasn\u2019t com- \u2014 didn\u2019t complete the background check within three days.\u00a0 \u00a0 there\u2019s a process.\u00a0 if wasn\u2019t done in three days, according to charleston loophole, you get to buy the gun.\u00a0 they bought the gun and killed a hell of a lot of innocent people who invited him to pray with them. \u00a0 and three, reauthorize the violence against women act, which \u2014 the so-called \u2014 close \u2014 (applause) \u2014 the \u201cboyfriend\u201d and \u201cstalking\u201d loopholes to keep guns out of the hands of people found by a court to be an abuser and continuing threat. \u00a0 i held over a thousand hours of hearings to pass the violence against women act, and one thing came through.\u00a0 if, in fact, a stay-away order \u2014 an order preventing the abuser from coming in a certain distance of the person he has abused or she has abused \u2014 and now the idea that they can own a weapon when they have a court order saying they are an abuser?\u00a0 \u00a0 these are some of the best tools we have right now to prevent gun violence and save lives.\u00a0 but all these bills, they had support of both democrats and republicans in the house.\u00a0 and universal background checks are supported by the vast majority of the american people and, i might add, the vast majority of responsible gun owners. \u00a0 so let me be clear: this is not a partisan issue among the american people.\u00a0 this is a view by the american people as an american issue.\u00a0 and i\u2019m willing to work with anyone to get these done. and it\u2019s long past time that we act.\u00a0 \u00a0 now, i know this has been a hobbyhorse of mine for a long time \u2014 got it done once.\u00a0 we should also ban assault weapons and high-capacity magazines in this country.\u00a0 (applause.) \u00a0 for that 10 years we had it done, the number of mass shootings actually went down.\u00a0 even law enforcement officials have told me and told other champions of this legislation they sometimes feel outgunned by assault weapons with large-capacity magazines.\u00a0 \u00a0 there\u2019s no reason someone needs a weapon of war with 100 rounds, 100 bullets that can be fired from that weapon.\u00a0 nobody needs that.\u00a0 nobody needs that. \u00a0 we got that done when i was a united states senator.\u00a0 it wasn\u2019t easy going up against the gun lobby, but it saved lives.\u00a0 and we should also eliminate gun manufacturers from the immunity they received from the congress.\u00a0 (applause.) \u00a0 you realize \u2014 again, the people here \u2014 because they\u2019re so knowledgeable out here in the rose garden.\u00a0 but what people don\u2019t realize: the only industry in america \u2014 a billion-dollar industry \u2014 that can\u2019t be sued \u2014 has exempt from being sued \u2014 are gun manufacturers.\u00a0 \u00a0 imagine how different it would be had that same exemption been available to tobacco companies who knew \u2014 who knew and lied about the danger they were causing \u2014 the cancer caused and the like.\u00a0 imagine where we\u2019d be. \u00a0 but this is the only outfit that is exempt from being sued. if i get one thing on my list \u2014 the lord came down and said, \u201cjoe, you get one of these\u201d \u2014 give me that one.\u00a0 (applause.)\u00a0 because i tell you what, there would be a \u201ccome to the lord\u201d moment these folks would have real quickly.\u00a0 but they\u2019re not.\u00a0 they\u2019re not. they\u2019re exempt.\u00a0 \u00a0 i know that the conversation about guns in this country can be a difficult one.\u00a0 but even here, there\u2019s much more common ground than we \u2014 anyone would believe.\u00a0 there\u2019s much more common ground. \u00a0 everything that\u2019s being proposed today is totally consistent with the second amendment.\u00a0 and there\u2019s a wide consensus behind the need to take action. \u00a0 i know that when overwhelming majorities of americans want to see something change that will affect their lives and it still doesn\u2019t change, it can be demoralizing to our fellow citizens.\u00a0 it can feel like our entire political process is broken.\u00a0 \u00a0 i know it\u2019s painful and frustrating that we haven\u2019t made the progress that we\u2019d hoped for.\u00a0 but it took five years to get the brady bill passed, and it took even more years to work to pass the assault weapons ban.\u00a0 and it saved lives.\u00a0 \u00a0 no matter how long it takes, we\u2019re going to get these passed.\u00a0 we\u2019re not going to give up.\u00a0 we have an opportunity to fulfill the first responsibility of government: to keep our people safe.\u00a0 and in the process, we can show the world and show ourselves that democracy works, that we can come together and get big things done. \u00a0 when i look around and see such brave survivors sitting out here in the rose garden, public servants who devoted their lives to dealing with this, advocates who feel strongly and are pushing every day to make the rational changes, and courageous parents and family members, i know that progress, even in this most difficult of issues, is possible. \u00a0 so, folks, this is just the start.\u00a0 we\u2019ve got a lot of work to do.\u00a0 but i know almost every one of you sitting in the garden here; none of you have ever given up.\u00a0 we\u2019re not going to give up now.\u00a0 \u00a0 the idea that we have so many people dying every single day from gun violence in america is a blemish on our character as nation. \u00a0 let me say to all of you: god bless you, but most importantly, the memory of all many of you have lost to this senseless gun violence.\u00a0 \u00a0 and now i\u2019d like to hand it over to the attorney general for him to speak and make some comments.\u00a0 and i hope i get a chance to see some of you after this is over.\u00a0 \u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 thank you.\u00a0 thank you.

afternoon, everyone.\u00a0 last weekend, in pittsburgh, pennsylvania, i announced my plan to rebuild what i refer to as the \u201cbackbone of america\u201d through the american jobs plan.\u00a0 it\u2019s not a plan that tinkers around the edges; it\u2019s a once-in-a-generation investment in america unlike anything we\u2019ve done since we built the interstate highway system and won the space race decades ago. it\u2019s the single largest investment in american jobs since world war two, and it\u2019s a plan that puts millions of americans to work to fix what\u2019s broken in our country: tens of thousands of miles of roads and highways, thousands of bridges in desperate need of repair. but it also is a blueprint for infrastructure needed for tomorrow \u2014 not just yesterday; tomorrow \u2014 for american jobs, for american competitiveness. last week, i said that once congress is back from recess, i\u2019d get to work right away because we have no time to lose.\u00a0 so here we are.\u00a0 democrats, republicans will have ideas about what they like and what they don\u2019t like about our plan.\u00a0 that\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s a good thing.\u00a0 that\u2019s the american way.\u00a0 that\u2019s the way democracy works.\u00a0 debate is welcome.\u00a0 compromise is inevitable.\u00a0 changes are certain.\u00a0 in the next few weeks, the vice president and i will be meeting with republicans and democrats to hear from everyone.\u00a0 and we\u2019ll be listening.\u00a0 we\u2019ll be open to good ideas and good-faith negotiations.\u00a0 but here\u2019s what we won\u2019t be open to: we will not be open to doing nothing.\u00a0 inaction simply is not an option.\u00a0 now, since i announced this plan, i\u2019ve heard from my republican friends say that it\u2019s \u2014 many of them say it\u2019s too big.\u00a0 they say, \u201cwhy not focus on traditional infrastructure, fix what we\u2019ve already got \u2014 the roads and the highways that exist and the bridges?\u201d i\u2019m happy to have that debate.\u00a0 but i\u2019d like to tell you my view.\u00a0 we are america.\u00a0 we don\u2019t just fix for today; we build for tomorrow.\u00a0 two hundred years ago, trains weren\u2019t \u201ctraditional\u201d infrastructure either until america made a choice to lay down tracks across the country.\u00a0 highways weren\u2019t \u201ctraditional\u201d infrastructure until we allowed ourselves to imagine that roads could connect our nation across state lines. the idea of infrastructure has always evolved to meet the aspirations of the american people and their needs, and it\u2019s evolving again today. we need to start seeing infrastructures through its effect on the lives of working people in america.\u00a0 what is the foundation today that they need to carve out their place in the middle class to make it \u2014 to live, to go to work, to raise their families with dignity, to ensure that good jobs will be there for their kids, no matter who they are or what zip code they live in?\u00a0 that\u2019s what infrastructure means in the 21st century.\u00a0 it still depends on roads and bridges, ports and airports, rail and mass transit, but it also depends on having reliable, high-speed internet in every home. \u00a0because today\u2019s high-speed internet is infrastructure.\u00a0 it depends on the electric grid \u2014 a grid that won\u2019t collapse in a winter storm or be compromised by hackers at home or abroad.\u00a0 it depends on investing in \u201cmade in america\u201d goods from every american community, including those that have historically been left out \u2014 black, latino, asian american, native americans, rural communities. talk to folks around the country about what really makes up the foundation of a good economy.\u00a0 ask a teacher or a childcare worker if having clean drinking water \u2014 non-contaminated drinking water in our schools, in our childcare centers is part of that foundation \u2014 when we know that the lead in our pipes slows a child\u2019s development when they drink that water.\u00a0 ask the entrepreneur whose small business was destroyed by the second 100-year flood in the last 10 years in iowa \u2014 or wildfires in the west that burned 5 million acres last year, an area roughly the size of the entire state of new jersey.\u00a0 more fires than ever.\u00a0 or the devastating damage \u2014 seeing more frequent and more intense hurricanes and storms on the east and gulf coasts. ask all those farmers and small-business owners and homeowners whether investing in clean energy to fight the effects of climate change is part of infrastructure.\u00a0 ask folks in rural america, where more than 35 percent of the people lack a reliable, high-speed internet, limiting their ability to conduct business or engage in remote learning for their schools.\u00a0 ask them whether investing in internet access will lead to better jobs in town, new markets for farmers, and better opportunities for their kids.\u00a0 and i\u2019m serious about this.\u00a0 ask the moms and dads in the \u201csandwich generation\u201d \u2014 the folks carrying enormous personal and financial strains trying to raise their children and care for their parents \u2014 their elderly parents or members of their families with a disability.\u00a0 ask them what sort of infrastructure they need to build a little better life, to be able to breathe a little bit. it\u2019s expanded services for seniors.\u00a0 it\u2019s homecare workers, who go in and cook their meal, help them get around and live independently in their home, allowing them to stay in their homes \u2014 and i might add, saving medicaid hundreds of millions of dollars in the process. it\u2019s better wages and benefits and opportunities for caregivers, who are disproportionately women, women of color, and immigrants.\u00a0 or ask our wounded warriors and military families. to my republican colleagues in congress, shouldn\u2019t we modernize va hospitals, update them?\u00a0 many of them are more than 50 years old. how about the estimated 450,000 post-9/11 veterans with post-traumatic stress disorder, who, when they make that emergency call \u2014 or their husband, wife, son, daughter makes that call to the va hospital \u2014 \u201cdad needs help, we have to bring him in.\u201d\u00a0 and they hear, \u201cyou have to wait.\u00a0 we don\u2019t have room now.\u00a0 come back.\u00a0 call me back in 8 days, 10 days, 12 days.\u201d look at the sui- \u2014 more suicides in the military than people getting shot.\u00a0 is it really your position, my friends, that our veterans don\u2019t deserve the most modern facilities?\u00a0 we could catch that cancer diagnosis quicker, with access to better roads, cleaner water, high-speed internet that delivers information faster and more of it. above all, infrastructure is about meeting the needs of a nation and putting americans to work and being able to do and get paid for doing \u2014 having good jobs.\u00a0 plumbers and pipefitters replacing those, literally, thousands of miles of \u2014 of dangerous lead pipes.\u00a0 they\u2019re still out there. everybody remembers what happened in flint.\u00a0 there\u2019s hundreds of flints all across america.\u00a0 how many of you know, when you send your child to school, the fountain they\u2019re drinking out of is not fed by a lead pipe?\u00a0 how many of you know the school your child is in still has asbestos in the walls and lacks the ventilation?\u00a0 is that not infrastructure?\u00a0 line workers and electricians laying transmission lines for a modern grid, providing over 500,000 charging stations on the highways we are going to build to accommodate electric vehicles so we can own the future.\u00a0 construction workers and engineers building modern hospital \u2014 modern hospitals and homes for american families.\u00a0 healthcare workers, steelworkers, folks who work in the cutting-edge labs.\u00a0 nearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created by our american jobs plan can be filled by people who don\u2019t have a college degree.\u00a0 seventy-five percent don\u2019t need an associate\u2019s degree. as i said last week, this is a blue-collar blueprint for increasing opportunity for the american people.\u00a0 it also includes the biggest investment in non-defense research and development on record. i promise you \u2014 this is not part of my speech \u2014 but i promise you, you\u2019re all going to be reporting over the next six to eight months how china and the rest of the world is racing ahead of us in the investments they have in the future, attempting to own the future.\u00a0 the technology, quantum computing, investing significant amounts of money and dealing with cancer and alzheimer\u2019s \u2014 that\u2019s the infrastructure of a nation.\u00a0 there\u2019s a new book out about how our \u2014 we\u2019ve fallen behind.\u00a0 america is no longer the leader of the world because we\u2019re not investing.\u00a0 it used to be we invested almost 2.7 percent of our gdp in infrastructure.\u00a0 now it\u2019s about 0.7 percent.\u00a0 when we were investing in it, we were the leader in the world.\u00a0 i don\u2019t know why we don\u2019t get this.\u00a0 one of the only \u2014 a few major economies in the world whose public investment in research and development has declined as a percentage of gdp in the last 25 years \u2014 declined: the united states of america \u2014 that led the world. why does this matter?\u00a0 investing in research and development help lead to lithium batteries, led technology, the internet itself.\u00a0 it helped lead to vaccine breakthroughs that are helping us beat covid-19; to the human genome project, which has led to breakthroughs in how we understand and fight cancer and other diseases.\u00a0 government \u2014 meaning, the taxpayers \u2014 funded this research.\u00a0 government.\u00a0 when we stop investing in research, we stop investing in the jobs of the future, and we give up leading the world.\u00a0 and when we do invest in research, what we\u2019re really doing is raising the bar on what we can imagine. imagine a world where you and your family can travel coast to coast without a single tank of gas, or in a high-speed train, close to as fast as you can go across the country in a plane.\u00a0 imagine your children growing up to work in innovation, good-paying jobs in fields that haven\u2019t even been invented yet, like the parents of every computer programmer, every graphic designer, every renewable energy worker once did \u2014 imagined.\u00a0 we invest today so that these jobs will be here in america tomorrow, so america can lead the world that is \u2014 as it\u2019s historically done. that\u2019s why i brought back scientists into the white house.\u00a0 we need to think.\u00a0 look, do we think the rest of world is waiting around?\u00a0 \u201cwe\u2019re not going to make those kinds of investments,\u201d the rest of the world is saying.\u00a0 take a look.\u00a0 do you think china is waiting around to invest in this digital infrastructure or in research and development?\u00a0 i promise you, they are not waiting, but they\u2019re counting on american democracy to be too slow, too limited, and too divided to keep pace.\u00a0 you\u2019ve heard me say it before: i think this generation is going to be marked by the competition between democracies and autocracies, because the world is changing so rapidly.\u00a0 the autocrats are betting on democracy not being able to generate the kind of unity needed to make decisions to get in that race.\u00a0 we can\u2019t afford to prove them right.\u00a0 we have to show the world \u2014 and much more importantly, we have to show ourselves \u2014 that democracy works; that we can come together on the big things.\u00a0 it\u2019s the united states of america for god\u2019s sake.\u00a0 of course, building the infrastructure of tomorrow requires major investments today.\u00a0 as i said last week, i\u2019m open to ideas about how to pay for this plan, with one exception: i will not impose any tax increases on people making less than $400,000 a year.\u00a0 if others have ideas out there on how to pay for this investment without violating that rule, they should come forward.\u00a0 there\u2019s all kinds of opportunities.\u00a0 just list all the tax breaks that i find difficult to explain:\u00a0wealthy deductions, $360 billion if you cap them; top rate of 39 percent, which it used to be for a hundred \u2014 for years, all the way to the bush administration; almost a quarter of a trillion dollars, corporate minimum tax; and the fossil fuel giveaways at $40 billion, et cetera.\u00a0 i could go on.\u00a0 but let me tell you what i proposed, how to do it.\u00a0 we\u2019re going to raise the corporate tax rate.\u00a0 it was 35 percent for the longest time, which was too high.\u00a0 barack and i thought it was too high during our administration.\u00a0 we all agreed five years ago that it should come down somewhat, but the previous administration reduced it all the way down to 21 percent.\u00a0 what i\u2019m proposing is that we meet in the middle: 28 percent.\u00a0 twenty-eight percent \u2014 we\u2019ll still have lower corporate rates than any time between world war two and 2017.\u00a0 it will generate over a trillion dollars in taxes over 15 years.\u00a0 a new, independent study put out last week found that at least 55 of our largest corporations lose the very \u2014 use the various loopholes to pay zero federal tax \u2014 income tax \u2014 in 2020.\u00a0 it\u2019s just not fair.\u00a0 it\u2019s not fair to the rest of the american taxpayers. we\u2019re going to \u2014 we\u2019re going to try to put an end to this.\u00a0 not fleece them \u2014 28 percent.\u00a0 if you\u2019re a mom, a dad, a cop, firefighter, police officer, et cetera, you\u2019re paying close to that in your income tax.\u00a0 i\u2019ve also proposed a global minimum tax, which is being proposed around the world for u.s. corporations, of 21 percent.\u00a0 let me tell you that means.\u00a0 it means that companies aren\u2019t going to be able to hide their income in places like the cayman islands and bermuda, in tax havens.\u00a0 we\u2019re going to also eliminate deductions used by corporations for offshoring jobs and shifting assets overseas.\u00a0 they offshore the jobs, shift the assets overseas, and then don\u2019t have to pay taxes on all they make there.\u00a0 and we\u2019ll significantly ramp up is \u2014 irs enforcement against corporations and the super wealthy who either failed to report their income or underreported.\u00a0 estimated, that would raise tens of billions of dollars.\u00a0 it adds up to more than what i proposed in just 15 years.\u00a0 it\u2019s honest.\u00a0 it\u2019s fair.\u00a0 it\u2019s fiscally responsible.\u00a0 and it pays for what we need and reduces the debt over the long haul.\u00a0 and, by the way, i didn\u2019t hear any of our friends, who are criticizing this plan, say that the corporate tax cut, which added $2 trillion to the debt \u2014 the trump tax cut, $2 trillion \u2014 $1.9 trillion in debt \u2014 wasn\u2019t paid for, the vast majority of which went to the top 1 percent of the wage earners.\u00a0 i didn\u2019t hear anybody hollering in this recovery \u2014 the so-called \u2014 before i became president \u2014 this \u201ck-shaped\u201d recovery, where billionaires made $300 billion more dollars during this period.\u00a0 where\u2019s the outrage there? i\u2019m not trying to punish anybody.\u00a0 but damn it, maybe it\u2019s because i come from a middle-class neighborhood, i\u2019m sick and tired of ordinary people being fleeced.\u00a0 let me close by saying this: whatever part- \u2014 partisan divisions there are around other issues, there don\u2019t have to be around this one.\u00a0 the divisions of the moment shouldn\u2019t stop us from doing the right thing for the future.\u00a0 these aren\u2019t republican bridges, democratic airports, republican hospitals, or a democratic power grid. think of the transcontinental railroad, interstate highway system, or the space race.\u00a0 we\u2019re one nation, united and connected. as i said last week, i\u2019m going to bring republicans to the white house.\u00a0 i invite them to come.\u00a0 we\u2019ll have good-faith negotiations.\u00a0 and any republican who wants to get this done, i invite.\u00a0 i invite them. \u00a0we have to get this \u2014 things done. we\u2019re at an inflection point in american democracy.\u00a0 this is a moment where we prove whether or not democracy can deliver.\u00a0 whether it can lay the foundation for an economy built from the bottom up and the middle out, not trickle-down economics from the very top.\u00a0 whether it can lay a good foundation for good jobs in a 21st century economy. i tell the kids \u2014 the young people who work for me and to all my kids \u2014 when i go on college campuses, they\u2019re going to see more change in the next 10 years than we\u2019ve seen in the last 50 years.\u00a0 we\u2019re going to talk about commercial aircraft flying at subsonic speeds \u2014 supersonic speeds.\u00a0 be able to, figuratively, if you may \u2014 if we decided to do it, traverse the world in about an hour, travel 21,000 miles an hour.\u00a0 so much is changing.\u00a0 we have got to lead it.\u00a0 i believe democracy can come through when the american people come together.\u00a0 we saw it in the american rescue plan.\u00a0 we\u2019re seeing it with the jobs plan. \u00a0and the american rescue plan, which got so badly criticized \u2014 how many of my republican colleagues have you seen gone on your stations or your newspapers and say, \u201cboy, people in my state really like it\u201d?\u00a0 because it would be improper having permission.\u00a0 the number of republicans and democrats who were hesitant and have called me saying, \u201cgod, this really works.\u201d overwhelming majority of the american people \u2014 democrats, republics, and independents \u2014 support infrastructure investments that meets the moment. so, i urge the congress: listen to your constituents and, together, we can lay a foundation for an economy that works for everyone and allows america to remain the world leader.\u00a0 when we do that, i believe, as i said last week, that in 50 years from now, when people look back, they\u2019ll say this was the moment, together, that we won america\u2019s future.\u00a0 i really believe that. thank you all.\u00a0 and god bless you.\u00a0 and may god protect our troops.\u00a0 thank you. q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mr. president, are you willing to go lower than the 28 percent corporate tax rate? the president:\u00a0 i\u2019m willing to listen to that.\u00a0 i\u2019m willing to \u2014 i\u2019m wide open to, but we\u2019ve got to pay for this.\u00a0 we got to pay.\u00a0 there\u2019s many other ways we can do it, but i\u2019m willing to negotiate that. i\u2019ve come \u2014 i\u2019ve come forward with the best, most rational way \u2014 in my view, the fairest way, to pay for it.\u00a0 but there are many other ways as well, and i\u2019m open. q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 will you have failed on your promise of bipartisanship if you don\u2019t get republicans on board with this plan?\u00a0 your first plan passed along party lines. the president:\u00a0 look, what i said was i would try to work with my friends on the other side.\u00a0 there are things we\u2019re working on together \u2014 some of which we\u2019ve passed and some we will pass. but the last plan i laid out what was available, what i was suggesting, and how i\u2019d deal with it.\u00a0 and a bipartisan group came to see me.\u00a0 and then a republican group came to see me.\u00a0 and they started off at $600 billion, and that was it. if they come forward with a plan that did the bulk of it and it was a billion \u2014 three or four, two or three \u2014 that allowed me to have pieces of all that was in there, i would have been \u2014 i would\u2019ve been prepared to compromise, but they didn\u2019t.\u00a0 they didn\u2019t move an inch.\u00a0 not an inch. but, for example, i am dealing with a bipartisan group that came to see me.\u00a0 now it\u2019s about \u2014 what? \u2014 three, four weeks ago when they came about computer chips and about \u2014 and they said, \u201clook, we have to have our own supply.\u00a0 we have to work together.\u201d\u00a0 we\u2019re working on that.\u00a0 chuck schumer and, i think, mcconnell are about to introduce a bill along those lines. so i\u2019m prepared to work.\u00a0 i really am.\u00a0 but to automatically say that the only thing that\u2019s infrastructure is a highway, a bridge, or whatever \u2014 that\u2019s just not rational.\u00a0 it really isn\u2019t. i think the vast majority of americans think everything from the sewer pipes, to the \u2014 to the \u2014 the sewer facilities, to the water pipes \u2014 i think they\u2019re infrastructure. anyway.\u00a0 thank you all so very much. q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 mr. president, can you talk about jordan, sir? q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 what are you going to do on guns, mr. president? the president:\u00a0 i\u2019ll be talking to you about that, i think, the day after tomorrow. q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 ghost guns? the president:\u00a0 thank you. q\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 can you tell us what you told the king of jordan, mr. president?\u00a0 are you concerned about the situation there? the president:\u00a0 no, i\u2019m not.\u00a0 i just called to tell him that he has a friend in america.\u00a0 stay strong. 2:30 p.m. edt"},
