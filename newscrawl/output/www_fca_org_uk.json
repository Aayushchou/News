'this research has helped us better understand what drives and motivates consumers so we can tell them about the risks involved in these investments through our investment harm campaign. 'we want to make sure that we encourage the ability to save and invest for lifetime events, particularly for younger generations, but it is imperative that consumers do so with savings and investment products that have a suitable level of risk for their needs. investors need to be mindful of their overall risk appetite, diversifying their investments and only investing money they can afford to lose in high risk products. 'we also hope our research\u00a0will\u00a0provide valuable insights\u00a0for other organisations\u00a0that are involved in tackling harm in this market.' the research shows that investors often have high confidence and claimed knowledge. however, it also shows a lack of awareness and/or belief in the risks of investing, with over 4 in 10 not viewing \u2018losing some money\u2019 as one of the risks of investing, even though as with most investments their whole capital is at risk. in some cases, investors can lose more than they initially invested for example with contract for difference investments. these investors also have a strong reliance on gut instinct and rules of thumb, with almost four in five (78%) agreeing \u201ci trust my instincts to tell me when it\u2019s time to buy and to sell\u201d and 78% also agreeing \u201cthere are certain investment types, sectors or companies i consider a \u2018safe bet\u2019\u201d. research findings indicate that this newer audience has a more diverse set of characteristics than traditional investors. they tend to skew more towards being female, under 40 and from a bame background. this newer group of self-investors are more reliant on contemporary media (e.g. youtube, social media) for tips and news. this trend appears to be prompted by the accessibility offered by new investment apps. these younger investors may have the lowest levels of financial resilience making them more vulnerable to investment loss. research showed that a significant loss could have a fundamental lifestyle impact on 59% of self-directed investors with less than 3 years' experience, who are more likely to own high risk investment products, compared with 38% of investors with greater than 3 years\u2019 experience. tackling harm in the consumer investment market is a priority for the fca. the fca commissioned britainthinks to conduct in-depth research into self-directed investors\u2019 behaviours, attitudes and financial resilience. together with feedback from its call for input on the consumer investment market, this research will underpin the fca's work in the consumer investment market. in particular, the research will help design a new campaign to address the harm caused from consumers investing in high risk, high return, illiquid investments that may not be suitable for their needs. alongside the publication of this research, the fca has today launched its digital disruption campaign to prevent investment harm. the campaign uses online advertising to disrupt investors\u2019 journeys and drive them to the high return investments webpage \u2013 which covers key questions consumers should ask before investing. the fca advises consumers to consider five important questions before they invest:\u00a0 am i comfortable with the level of risk? do i fully understand the investment being offered to me? am i protected if things go wrong? are my investments regulated? should i get financial advice? the fca has recently  published  work to tackle consumer harm in the investment market including banning the mass-marketing of speculative mini-bonds and will set out its further plans later this year. the regulator also published a  warning to consumers  on the dangers of investments advertising high returns based on cryptoassets. notes to editors understanding self-directed investors  research report . the project was conducted with britainthinks, an international insight and strategy consultancy. the research surveyed 517 self-directed investors and was conducted 18th august 2020 \u2013 20th january 2021. for the purposes of the report the fca defines self-directed investors as those who are making investment decisions on their own behalf,\u00a0i.e.\u00a0selecting investment types and making trades themselves rather than seeking financial advice.\u00a0\u00a0 in september the fca issued a  call for input on the consumer investment market , asking for comment on how consumer protection can be improved. responses to this are under review and the fca has already acted to ban the mass-marketing of speculative illiquid securities (including speculative mini-bonds) to retail investors. read a  summary  of our work to tackle consumer harm in the investment market, between 1 january and 31 october 2020. investment harms consumer  webpage . the fca is  examining  intergenerational differences in the financial needs and circumstances of each generation which has been  updated  to reflect the impact of the covid-19 pandemic. protecting vulnerable consumers is a key focus for the fca. our  business plan  for 2020/21 states that we will focus on making sure that the most vulnerable are protected. find out more information  about the fca . \n\t\t\t\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n    \n    \n          \n       \n                  \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   was this page helpful?

or where they do not apply. sheldon mills, executive director, consumers and competition at the fca, said: \u2018as we move into the next phase of the pandemic, we want to reassure consumers that they will continue to receive fair and appropriate support. we encourage those in difficulty to contact their lender to discuss their options. \u2018we\u2019ve been monitoring how firms are providing support and found they have responded well to the challenge of providing tailored support, but there is more to do. we\u2019ve set out where firms need to improve in a report on how they are implementing tailored support.\u2019 the report, which focuses on firm\u2019s capabilities to support consumers financially impacted by coronavirus, found that firms have progressed well in implementing the tsg and have acted quickly to build their capacity. however, it also highlights some areas for improvement, which firms are expected to address. the fca will continue to monitor firms over the coming months. the findings in the report, include: \u00a0 consumers have generally been able to get support as they come to the end of a payment deferral. the fca has not identified any systemic issues with firms' ability to meet the demand from customers seeking further help. the support identified in the report has typically been short term in nature given the uncertainty of customers\u2019 financial circumstances during the pandemic. all firms assessed had vulnerable customer policies in place, and it was noted that 94% of mortgage firms and 64% of credit firms had reviewed or added to them in light of the pandemic. firms are encouraged to review the recently published  guidance  on vulnerable consumers and to embed relevant aspects into their processes to ensure that vulnerable customers are treated fairly. due to the pandemic, some firms anticipated an increase in demand from customers in financial difficulty and recruited more staff to address that demand. as a result, there has been a significant increase in inexperienced staff helping customers, which may lead to an increased risk of harm. firms are expected to ensure that all staff are adequately trained and have appropriate oversight of new staff to ensure that the right support is provided to customers. some firms have accelerated plans to automate aspects of the customer support journey. the fca found that in general these automated approaches were easy to navigate with minimal steps and helpful menus for customers to select from. however, some firms could make some improvements, particularly around the ease of access to non-digital support. in september 2020, the fca published tsg covering mortgages and consumer credit, as well as additional overdrafts guidance. the fca committed to review the credit tsg after 6 months, which was extended to include mortgages and overdrafts. the fca has concluded that these pieces of guidance will continue to be relevant over the coming months, especially as the payment deferral guidance comes to an end. the fca will keep these pieces of guidance under review and will make changes if necessary. notes to editors coronavirus linked forbearance: key findings the report is based on a review of firms\u2019 policies and processes, as well as engagement with firms between 4 november 2020 and 25 february 2021 the sample of firms in the report covered approximately 50% of the total mortgage and consumer credit market (by market share) and comprised 17 mortgage firms (both 1st and 2nd charge), 15 personal loan and credit card firms, 18 higher cost firms, 9 motor finance firms and 9 retail finance firms (including premium finance firms). a detailed assessment was completed of the automated part of the customer journey for 9 firms. a number of the 8 largest retail banks and building societies were also included within the sample. finalised guidance: mortgages and coronavirus: further updated tailored support guidance for firms fs21/6:\u00a0coronavirus: tailored support guidance (tsg) for firms \u2013 feedback on draft guidance on home repossessions & statement of ongoing relevance of ts find out more information  about the fca . \n\t\t\t\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n    \n    \n          \n       \n                  \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   was this page helpful? \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       \n     radios \n   \n   \n             \n  \n  \n  \n\n       yes  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n\n       no  \n  \n  \n   \n\n           \n       what can we do to improve pages like this?\t \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       what did you find helpful? \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   submit feedback"},

{"header": "updated statement on non-damage bi settlements and deductions made for government support", "date": "2021-03-24t10:32:35z", "text": "on 3 august 2020, following complaints from policyholders and other stakeholders about insurers making deductions from business interruption (bi) insurance claim payout for some types of government support given to policyholders, we issued this statement: where insurers have accepted liability, they should continue to handle and assess non-damage bi claims promptly and fairly, and to treat their customers fairly in accordance with\u00a0 principle 6 . assessing whether it is appropriate to make deductions the insurer will need to assess this for some or all of each type of government support the policyholder received with a case by case assessment. the assessment should consider: the exact type and nature of the government support how the policyholder used this support the type of policy and its precise terms, including any set methodology for calculating the value of a claim set out under the relevant section of the policy some of these factors will be specific to the case and claim. even where it is appropriate in principle to deduct these amounts, a single, uniform approach to deductions is still unlikely to be appropriate. insurers are likely to need to consider individually the precise details of the policy, the claim and how the policyholder used the government support. how government support is treated for tax purposes may differ from the way it is treated for calculating the loss under a bi policy. our expectations of firms we expect firms to take these matters into account when they calculate non-damage bi claims. we also expect them to reflect these matters appropriately in their communications with policyholders when making settlement offers and reaching settlement on relevant bi claims. we will consider how firms treat their policyholders in this way as part of our usual supervisory activities. we may intervene and take further actions where firms do not appear to be meeting our expectations and treating their customers fairly on these points. on 18 september 2020, in a  dear ceo letter , we referred insurers to this statement. we also clarified that we consider: the government\u2019s treatment of the small business, retail, hospitality and leisure or local authority discretionary grants for tax purposes is not a proper basis for insurers to treat these payments as turnover under the policies. insurers could not apply these amounts as savings against fixed business expenses. this is because these amounts are not made for any particular business expense and policyholders will have used the grants in different ways. we confirmed our expectation that firms explicitly consider the treatment of the various forms of government support at board level and appropriately document \u00a0their consideration and conclusions. we told insurers that we would follow up with them individually as appropriate.\u00a0 we also advised that we would continue to consider the appropriateness of any deductions of any other form of government support when calculating the bi losses. on 25 september 2020, in discussions between the association of british insurers (abi) and the economic secretary to the treasury, the abi confirmed that a number of insurers have agreed not to deduct certain grants from covid-19 claim payments.\u00a0 ageas, allianz, aviva, axa xl, axa, chubb, covea, direct line group, ecclesiastical, hiscox, nfu mutual, qbe, rsa and zurich have agreed not to deduct the following grants: local authority grant small business grant leisure/retail/hospitality grants local restrictions support grant (closed) local restrictions support grant (open) additional restrictions grant (arg) and local restrictions support grant (lrsg (closed) addendum) or their equivalents in scotland, wales and northern ireland. our view is that the scottish pivotal enterprise resilience fund is an example of an equivalent grant. even if your policy is with a different insurer to those listed above, our views about the appropriateness of deducting small business grants still apply. \n\n\t\t\t\n   \n\n\t\t\t\t\t\t \n\n    \n    \n          \n       \n                  \n \n  \n   \n  \n  \n   was this page helpful? \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       \n     radios \n   \n   \n             \n  \n  \n  \n\n       yes  \n  \n  \n   \n  \n  \n  \n\n       no  \n  \n  \n   \n\n           \n       what can we do to improve pages like this?\t \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   \n       what did you find helpful? \n  \n  \n   \n   \n\n\n  \n  \n   submit feedback"},
