'very damaging' anti-money laundering expert tony wyatt, from ewing law, said it was \"surprising that amount of cash could have been banked given the sensitivity that even small business and retail customers experience when banking any large cash amounts\".  as well as unlimited fines, a criminal conviction can make life very difficult indeed for banks.  natwest sets aside \u00a33.2bn to cover bad loans while the fca told the bbc it would not be seeking to withdraw any of its licences permissions to trade in the uk, overseas jurisdictions - particularly the us - can exact harsh penalties for banks found to be involved in money laundering.  standard chartered and hsbc, both uk-headquartered banks, were fined billions of dollars by us authorities.  jonathan fisher qc, of bright line law, told the bbc the incident was \"very damaging to natwest. they will come through this, but some big business customers may question whether they should be using a bank that is alleged to have made such basic anti-money laundering failures\". insiders at natwest sounded genuinely deflated that, after feeling progress had been made in mending its reputation after the horrors of the financial crisis and subsequent scandals, the bank formerly known as royal bank of scotland would have its new name - natwest as of last year -  dragged through the mud. in a statement, natwest said it took its responsibilities to prevent money laundering \"extremely seriously\" and had been co-operating with the fca.  the bank is scheduled to appear at westminster magistrates court on 14 april. no individuals are being charged as part of the proceedings. related topics money laundering natwest group uk banking financial conduct authority (fca) companies banking more on this story natwest sets aside \u00a33.2bn to cover bad loans published 19 february"},

september 2020 share close share page copy link about sharing leaked documents involving about $2tn of transactions have revealed how some of the world's biggest banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. they also show how russian oligarchs have used banks to avoid sanctions that were supposed to stop them getting their money into the west. it's the latest in a string of leaks over the past five years that have exposed secret deals, money laundering and financial crime. what are the fincen files? the fincen files are more than 2,500 documents, most of which were files that banks sent to the us authorities between 2000 and 2017. they raise concerns about what their clients might be doing.  these documents are some of the international banking system's most closely guarded secrets. banks use them to report suspicious behaviour but they are not proof of wrongdoing or crime. they were leaked to buzzfeed news and shared with a group that brings together investigative journalists from around the world, which distributed them to 108 news organisations in 88 countries, including the bbc's panorama programme. hundreds of journalists have been sifting through the dense, technical documentation, uncovering some of the activities that banks would prefer the public not to know about.  \n/* sc-component-id: bbclogo__svg-s6hgfth-0

suspicious activity reports source: icij two acronyms you need to know fincen is the us financial crimes enforcement network. these are the people at the us treasury who combat financial crime. concerns about transactions made in us dollars need to be sent to fincen, even if they took place outside the us. suspicious activity reports, or sars, are an example of how those concerns are recorded. a bank must fill in one of these reports if it is worried one of its clients might be up to no good. the report is sent to the authorities. why does this matter? if you are planning to profit from a criminal enterprise, one of the most important things to have in place is a way of laundering the money. laundering money is the process of taking dirty money - the proceeds of crimes such as drug dealing or corruption - and getting it into an account at a respected bank where it will not be linked with the crime. the same process is needed if you are a russian oligarch whom western countries have taken sanctions against to stop you getting your money into the west. banks are supposed to make sure they don't help clients to launder money or move it around in ways that break the rules. by law, they have to know who their clients are - it's not enough to file sars and keep taking dirty money from clients while expecting the authorities to deal with the problem. if they have evidence of criminal activity they should stop moving the cash. fergus shiel from the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) said the leaked files were an \"insight into what banks know about the vast flows of dirty money across the globe\". he said the documents also highlighted the extraordinarily large amounts of money involved. the documents in the fincen files cover about $2tn of transactions and they are only a tiny proportion of the sars submitted over the period. what has been revealed? hsbc allowed fraudsters to move millions  of dollars of stolen money around the world, even after it learned from us investigators the scheme was a scam. jp morgan allowed a company to move more than $1bn  through a london account without knowing who owned it. the bank later discovered the company might be owned by a mobster on the fbi's 10 most wanted list. evidence that one of russian president vladimir putin's closest associates  used barclays bank in london to avoid sanctions  which were meant to stop him using financial services in the west. some of the cash was used to buy works of art. the husband of a woman who has donated \u00a31.7m to the uk's governing conservative party's was  secretly funded by a russian oligarch  with close ties to president putin. the  uk is called a \"higher risk jurisdiction\"  and compared to cyprus, by the intelligence division of fincen. that's because of the number of uk registered companies that appear in the sars. over 3,000 uk companies are named in the fincen files - more than any other country. chelsea owner  roman abramovich once held secret investments in footballers  not owned by his club through an offshore company. the  united arab emirates' central bank failed to act on warnings  about a local firm which was helping iran evade sanctions. deutsche bank  moved money launderers' dirty money for organised crime, terrorists and drug traffickers.  more details  (buzzfeed news) standard chartered  moved cash for arab bank for more than a decade after clients' accounts at the jordanian bank had been used in funding terrorism.  image copyright epa image caption canary wharf, the heart of london's banking network why is this leak different? there have been a number of big leaks of financial information in recent years, including: 2017 paradise papers  - a huge batch of leaked documents from an offshore legal service provider  appleby  and corporate services provider  estera . the two operated together under the appleby name until estera became independent in 2016. they revealed the  offshore financial dealings of politicians, celebrities and business leaders 2016 panama papers  - leaked documents from the law firm  mossack fonseca  showed more about  how wealthy people were using offshore tax regimes  to their benefit 2015 swiss leaks  - documents from  hsbc's swiss private bank  showed how it was using  the country's banking secrecy laws  to help clients avoid paying tax 2014 luxleaks  contained documents from the accountancy firm  pricewaterhousecoopers  showing that big companies were using  tax deals in luxembourg to reduce the amount they were having to pay the fincen papers are different because they are not just documents from one or two companies - they come from a number of banks. they highlight a range of potentially suspicious activity involving companies and individuals and also raise questions about why the banks which had noticed this activity did not always act on their concerns. once a bank has filed a report to the authorities, it is very difficult to prosecute it or its executives, even if it carries on helping with the suspicious activities and collecting the fees. fincen said the leak could impact on us national security, compromise investigations, and threaten the safety of institutions and individuals who file the reports. but last week it announced proposals to  overhaul its anti-money laundering programmes . the uk has also unveiled plans to  reform its register of company information  to clamp down on fraud and money laundering. media caption a visit to one of the \u2018dodgiest addresses in

the us first imposed sanctions on iran during the 1979-1981 tehran hostage crisis. since then, successive us administrations have introduced measures intended to compel iran to change its behaviour, such as limiting its nuclear programme. one of these measures was to cut off iranian banks from the global banking system used to make payments in dollars in 2012. image copyright anadolu agency image caption reza zarrab pleaded guilty in the us to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges us prosecutors alleged that gunes general trading was part  of a network controlled by turkish-iranian gold trader reza zarrab  that conducted hundreds of millions of dollars' worth of transactions on behalf of the iranian government and other iranian entities that were barred under us sanctions.  gold trader's us legal saga grips turkey how renewed us sanctions have hit iran hard us-iran sanctions: what do they mean? there were no further concerns raised about the company's activities following zarrab's arrest in the us. in 2017, zarrab pleaded guilty to fraud, conspiracy and money laundering charges. he is yet to be sentenced. media caption this is how a dubai firm evaded us sanctions on iran, despite the uae central bank being warned what do the documents show? banks based in the uae rely on big us-based banks to monitor and approve their us dollar payments - a service known as \"correspondent banking\". correspondent banks are required to alert authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing, by filing  a document known as a suspicious activity report (sar) . among the fincen files is an sar that shows the new york branch of uk-based standard chartered bank contacted the central bank of the uae in 2012 after noticing hundreds of suspicious transactions by gunes general trading. the reports did not say any of this activity was linked to sanctions evasion by iran.  sars are a way to alert government regulators and law enforcement to irregular activity that should be investigated, although they are not necessarily evidence of wrongdoing. the central bank told standard chartered that \"the case has been passed on to law enforcement authorities\" and that \"accounts were closed in september 2011\".  but standard chartered flagged that the company was able to \"continue its suspicious activity\" by \"utilizing various accounts that [it] maintains with other banks\". in fact, the central bank failed to stop gunes general trading using two other accounts with two uae state-owned banks - rakbank, the national bank of the northern emirate ras al-khaimah, and the national bank of dubai (nbd). image copyright reuters image caption gunes general trading was based in the emirate of dubai the fincen files show gunes general trading was able to process a further $108m of transactions flagged as suspicious until september 2012, the majority of them through rakbank. rakbank said that because of confidentiality it does not comment on specific transactions but it complies with anti-money laundering and sanctions regulations and has strict policies in place to monitor this. nbd did not respond to the bbc's request for comment. in april 2013, the us bank of new york mellon filed a sar saying that following a us government inquiry into gunes general trading, it believed the company was conducting transactions in a manner designed to evade sanctions against iran. \"government authorities must both investigate alleged cases of financial crime and protect the integrity of the financial system,\" said tom keatinge, director of the centre for financial crime and security studies at the royal united services institute (rusi). \"this case brings into question the extent to which the uae central bank took the second part of this responsibility seriously. criminal actors thrive as a result of failures to share information, and this appears to be a prime example of such a failing.\" the fincen files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money to be moved around the world. they also show how the uk is often the weak link in the financial system and how london is awash with russian cash. the files were obtained by buzzfeed news which shared them with the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) and 400 journalists around the world. panorama has led research for the bbc. fincen files: full coverage ; follow reaction on twitter using #fincenfiles; in the bbc news app, follow the tag \"fincen files\" related topics money laundering united arab emirates iran iran sanctions banking"},

'suspicious activity' a leak of more than 2,000 \"suspicious activity reports\" sent by banks to the us financial crimes enforcement network (fincen) names more than 100 companies registered to suite 2b. unbeknown to the shoppers frequenting the nearby superdrug or buying a pasty at greggs, the room is a virtual thoroughfare for international financial crime. the us treasury, which houses fincen, believes it is one of the dodgiest addresses in the world. all you need to know about fincen documents leak hsbc moved ponzi scam millions tory donor linked to $8m putin ally funding \"if i were in charge of money laundering [detection] at a uk bank, all systems would be instructed that we do not process any payments to or from companies registered at that address,\" said financial crime consultant martin woods. the way the schemes work is intentionally complex. criminals in russia and other countries who want to launder their money take advantage of limited partnerships (lps) and limited-liability partnerships (llps). these are uk companies, used perfectly legitimately by thousands of businesses, that require the owners to file very limited information about their operations. criminals can use them to move large amounts of money anonymously. they pay \"formation agents\" as little as \u00a350 to register the lps and llps with companies house, where all uk firms are registered on their behalf. doing so gives a uk address through which to move their money - such as suite 2b, floor two, 175 darkes lane. but lps and llps can be managed from abroad, with the criminals' details very difficult to detect. often information given about the person setting up the company is not checked, so criminals can hide behind false names and aliases. using businesses registered in the uk helps legitimise the money on its way to being \"clean\". accounts inconsistencies lps and llps have hugely multiplied in number. in 2004 there were 20,000 in the uk. by 2017 there were 100,000. two of the firms registered at suite 2b were ergoinvest and chadborg trade. both had accounts with danske bank in estonia, which was involved in one of the world's  biggest money-laundering scandals  between 2005 and 2017. ergoinvest and chadborg trade reported identical income of just \u00a321,353 for one year. they also reported the same figures as each other for operating expenses and profit. these were fictitious figures. the difference between these accounts and reality is revealed in documents seen by the bbc's panorama, showing that $700m (\u00a3535m) went through ergoinvest and $2.6bn (\u00a31.99bn) went through chadborg. aleksej strukov, who runs suite 2b, said he had no access to companies' financial records and could not verify the information filed with companies house. \"our only role is the provision of the darkes lane address as their nominated registered office address, and in doing so, ensure we comply with the aml [anti-money laundering] regulations for that service,\" he said. mr strukov also said he conducted standard due diligence checks to verify the identities of company directors, shareholders and beneficial owners. 'high-risk' what happens in suite 2b is just one particularly large-scale example of the part the uk plays in global money laundering. a total of 3,282 british companies were named in the leaked suspicious activity reports - that's more than any other country in the world. and the flood of dirty money is damaging the uk's international reputation. a leaked us treasury report describes britain as a \"higher-risk jurisdiction\" and compares it to notorious financial centres \"such as cyprus\" in its role. banks around the world are supposed to ask the \"source of funds\" handled by them. but in recent years, they have been criticised for not doing so properly and governments, their resources stretched, have struggled to detect wrongdoing. \"money-laundering schemes are put together to make that difficult,\" said graham barrow, author of dark money. \"money launderers know this, and complexity is their friend. \"if it's gone through 17 bank accounts before you see it, it's hard [to track]. and that's what they do: they have multiple companies in multiple countries with multiple accounts and move the money backwards and forwards between them.\" the united nations estimates the annual value of international money laundering to be between $800bn (\u00a3607bn) and $1trillion (\u00a3760bn). that is between 2% and 5% of everything produced in every economy in the world. facing these revelations last week, the uk announced reforms to companies house. under the plans, directors will not be able to be appointed until their identity has been verified. companies house will also be given greater powers to query, investigate and remove false information, with the aim of increasing the reliability of the data showing who is behind each company. the changes will give \"law enforcement and the private sector more accurate information to crack down on dirty money and financial exploitation\", said security minister james brokenshire. in 2018, the uk government promised to bring in stronger controls over registering lps and to give officials powers to ask for more information while they are operating. but the use of these companies in money laundering is \"vanishingly difficult to investigate\", said mr barrow. and much of it happens in places like suite 2b in leafy potters bar. the fincen files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed criminals to move dirty money around the world. they also show how the uk is often the weak link in the financial system and how london is awash with russian cash. the files were obtained by buzzfeed news which shared them with the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) and 400 journalists around the world. panorama has led research for the bbc. fincen files: full coverage ; follow reaction on twitter using #fincenfiles; in the bbc news app, follow the tag \"fincen files;   watch panorama  on the bbc iplayer (uk viewers only). related topics money laundering potters bar"},

'honey badger' confidential documents seen by the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) and the bbc reveal the us treasury was urged by investigators in 2014 to issue the warning after a three-year investigation. codenamed \"honey badger\" and led by the drug enforcement administration (dea), the investigation concluded that kaloti was involved in a scheme to transport or transfer \"tremendous amounts of illicit value through the use of gold as a commodity\". under the scheme described in the documents, criminals anywhere in the world could use drug money or other unlawfully obtained cash to buy scrap gold such as second-hand jewellery and bring it to kaloti.  in exchange for the gold, according to investigators,  kaloti would offer bulk cash or send a wire transfer to them .   media caption how a drug gang laundered money in 2014, the dea recommended that the us treasury should publicly designate kaloti a \"primary money laundering concern\" under the us patriot act, which would have made it too risky for global banks to do business with them, freezing the group out of the global financial system.  but the us treasury never took action against kaloti. former officials said it put off a decision on the recommendation, concerned about the reaction of the united arab emirates, a key diplomatic ally, where kaloti was based.  when the uae failed to act on its own initiative, the investigation was shelved.   suspicious activity  kaloti did not have the chance to see or challenge any of the evidence as they were not questioned by investigators and there could be undisclosed reasons justifying why the report wasn't acted upon. attempts to obtain an explanation from the us treasury failed to draw a response.  the investigation, which the us government has never made public, was supported by a flood of reports of suspicious activity from banks across the world handling kaloti's money.  lenders including deutsche bank and barclays submitted 34 separate reports about kaloti to the us treasury's financial crime enforcement network (fincen), highlighting as suspicious thousands of transactions from 2007 to 2015 totalling $9.3bn (\u00a37.26bn).   in 2017 a money laundering gang was convicted in france of laundering the proceeds of drug sales all over europe including the uk. last october,  bbc panorama revealed  that a company controlled by the gang, renade international, had sold $146m (\u00a3114m) of gold to kaloti in 2012 alone - part of $5.2bn of gold purchases paid for with cash.   image copyright getty images image caption kaloti is based in dubai kaloti vehemently denies ever acting improperly and says it has never been accused or contacted by any us authority about wrongdoing. it says it performs full due diligence on all customers and suppliers.  lawyers for the firm said it had successfully passed audits each year against all regulatory and legal standards. supply chain fears the dea-led taskforce investigating kaloti submitted a report of their investigation and recommended the primary money laundering designation in august 2014.  but after the designation didn't materialise, gold sold by kaloti has continued  to end up in major supply chains. apple's list of approved suppliers includes entities which have purchased tonnes of gold from kaloti, including valcambi, one of the largest gold refiners in the world, based in switzerland.  all modern smartphones feature components made with gold, which is a highly conductive metal. this year the anti-corruption watchdog global witness reported that in 2018 and 2019, valcambi purchased up to 20 tonnes of gold directly from kaloti and a further 60 tonnes from a related entity.  a further report by the tech transparency project listed two further swiss refiners which had purchased gold from kaloti and were also on apple's list of suppliers.  valcambi said it would not confirm or deny buying gold from kaloti. the company said it only purchases gold from its suppliers \"where the company can fully ensure the identification of the origin of the gold\". in a statement, apple said it was committed to responsibly sourcing for its products: \"if a refiner is unable or unwilling to meet our standards, they will be removed from our supply chain. since 2015, we've stopped working with 63 refiners of gold for this reason. \"several thorough and independent reviews have been conducted since 2015, and there is no evidence that any gold from kaloti enters apple products.\" image copyright getty images image caption black market gold can be used to launder profits from the drug trade kaloti is listed as being in the supply chain for general motors and amazon, according to data submitted to the securities and exchange commission, the us regulator. general motors, which uses gold in car parts such as catalytic converters, said it was committed to responsible sourcing of goods used in its manufacturing and had not done business with kaloti directly.  it said none of its suppliers had shared any compliance issues or concerns regarding kaloti.  amazon said it was \"committed to ensuring that the products and services we provide are produced in a way that respects human rights and the environment. we engage with suppliers that are committed to these same principles.  \"we expect suppliers to support our effort to identify the origin of designated minerals used in our products.\" investigators who had worked for years to expose money laundering linked to kaloti describe themselves as \"incredibly frustrated\" by the us treasury's handling of the matter.  \"we put a tremendous amount of work and effort over three years into the case -

banks across the world rely on major western banks like standard chartered to help them move money in us dollars. the service is known as correspondent banking. the fincen files show that standard chartered began an investigation into us dollar payments that it had processed for arab bank after the 2014 trial. image copyright reuters image caption arab bank was sued by american relatives of victims of attacks by hamas in early 2016, standard chartered issued a suspicious activity report (sar), which alerts authorities to potential instances of criminal activity, such as money laundering or terrorist financing. the sar highlighted more than 900 payments that standard chartered believed might have been for \"illicit activities under the guise of charity\". the payments were labelled as \"charities\", \"donations\", \"support\" or \"gifts\", but \"a large majority\" of them were made \"by individuals who could not be verified in the public domain\", according to standard chartered's review. other payments triggered \"terrorism\" alerts. some appeared to be intended for \"specially designated nationals\" who were under us sanctions.  according to the sar, the suspicious payments prompted standard chartered's new york branch to \"[exit] its relationship\" with arab bank in 2016. what do the banks say? arab bank said: \"in every country where it operates, arab bank is in good standing with government regulators and complies with anti-terrorism and money laundering laws. no government or regulator has ever found that accounts or transactions processed by arab bank violated anti-terrorism laws.\" it said many of the allegations \"date back nearly 20 years\", and that the vast majority of the accounts involved had no known terrorist links at the time. arab bank added that it had never been notified by standard chartered that it had any concerns over transactions it processed for arab bank customers. although standard chartered stopped processing us dollar payments for arab bank, it continued to maintain a very good business relationship with standard chartered, it said.  standard chartered said it \"initiated account closure\" with arab bank shortly after the 2014 court verdict but that it was a process that took some time. it also said an sar \"is not an admission of fault on the part of the bank, nor is it conclusive evidence that wrongdoing has taken place\". \"only the proper authorities are in a position to make that determination.\" it added that it took its \"responsibility to fight financial crime extremely seriously\" and that it had \"invested substantially in compliance programmes\".   it had \"nearly 2,000 staff\" monitoring suspicious transactions, who last year \"monitored more than 1.2 billion transactions for potential suspicious activity\". the fincen files is a leak of secret documents which reveal how major banks have allowed dirty money to be moved around the world. they also show how the uk is often the weak link in the financial system and how london is awash with russian cash. the files were obtained by buzzfeed news which shared them with the international consortium of investigative journalists (icij) and 400 journalists around the world. panorama has led research for the bbc. fincen files: full coverage ; follow reaction on twitter using #fincenfiles; in the bbc news app, follow the tag \"fincen files\" related topics money laundering uk banking hamas jordan banking"},
