waters, ranking member mchenry, members of the committee, thank you for having me. \n\n we are meeting at a hopeful moment for the economy \u2013 but still a daunting one. while we\u2019re seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we\u2019re digging out of: the country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak. \n\n when congress passed the cares and consolidated appropriations acts last year, it gave the federal government some powerful tools to address the crisis. but upon taking office, i worried they weren\u2019t powerful enough. after all, there were \u2013 and still are \u2013 some very deep pockets of pain in the data. \n\n one-in-ten homeowners with a mortgage are behind on their payments, and almost one-in-five renters are behind on their rent. there are 22 million people who say they don\u2019t have enough food to eat. one-in-ten adults are hungry in america. \n\n i looked at data like these, and i worried that the covid economy was going to keep hurting millions of people now and haunt them long after the health emergency was over. \n\n we know that when the foundations of someone\u2019s life fall apart \u2013 when they lose the roof over their head or the ability to eat dinner every night \u2013 the pain can weigh on them for years. their earning potential is permanently lowered.\u00a0 i worried about this happening on a mass scale. \n\n that\u2019s why i advocated very hard for the american rescue plan, and it\u2019s why my first \u2013 and most enthusiastic \u2013 message today is: thank you. \n\n with the passage of the rescue plan, i am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact. and i believe they will be met there by a growing economy. in fact, i think we may see a return to full employment next year. \n\n of course, the speed and strength of our recovery depends, in part, on how we implement the legislation. treasury is tasked with much of that work, and there is nothing that i \u2013 or my team \u2013 take more seriously. we appreciate your oversight on this matter, and i want to briefly tell you about how we\u2019ve been working. \u00a0 \n\n since taking office two months ago, we have been expediting relief to the areas of greatest need. for example, small businesses \u2013 and especially the smallest small businesses, which are disproportionally owned by women and people of color. \n\n the pandemic has hit these businesses hard. the paycheck protection program was an early lifeline, but because of issues with the program\u2019s design, the first rounds often didn\u2019t reach the smallest sole proprietorships. we\u2019re addressing that now. we worked with sba to tweak how the program was implemented. it\u2019s allowing the ppp to reach millions more microbusinesses and entrepreneurs, especially in rural and low-income areas. \n\n we\u2019re also building capacity to support these communities over the longer term. because of the december legislation, treasury now has $12 billion to inject into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. in turn, these cdfis and mdis can lend that capital out, helping people buy homes and start businesses in places that the financial services sector traditionally hasn\u2019t served well. \u00a0 \n\n then, there are the families i spoke about, the ones struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table. \n\n the american rescue plan provides more than $30 billion to help renters and homeowners at risk of losing their homes. and we\u2019re making sure that assistance flows as efficiently as possible. \n\n for instance, the previous administration put in place rules that required tenants and landlords to provide quite a bit of documentation to get rental assistance, including detailed statements about their income. but some people don\u2019t have access to those documents. we\u2019re cutting through the red tape for them, while still taking reasonable steps to prevent fraud and abuse. \n\n and of course, we\u2019ve been sending direct payments to americans \u2013 a lot of americans. as of last week, we had issued over 90 million payments.\u00a0 \n\n and all this is just a fraction of treasury\u2019s work. there are so many more relief programs, including one that will provide $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. implementing all of it is more complicated than it sounds, and we are working closely with stakeholders to make sure that these programs are both efficient and effective. \n\n behind these many relief programs, these millions of transactions, are a staff of very dedicated (and very tired) treasury and irs employees. my final word is to them: thank you. you are putting on a master class in how government should work in the furnace of a crisis. i\u2019m grateful to be your colleague. \n\n with that, i am happy to answer any questions you have.\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n view: secretary yellen's cares oversight hearing --written testimony & addendum \n\n ###"},

{"header": "testimony of kimberly a. clausing, deputy assistant secretary, tax analysis, before the senate committee on finance", "date": "2021-03-25t13:30:00z", "text": "chairman wyden, ranking member crapo, members of the committee: thank you for inviting me to share these views on the international aspects of business tax reform. international tax reform feeds into our most important tax policy goals: building a tax system that is fit for purpose, fair, and focused on the needs of all americans.\u00a0\u00a0 \n\n in my testimony today, i will discuss several crucial issues related to international tax reform. first, we need better protections to defend the u.s. corporate tax base from the tax-motivated shifting of corporate profits to offshore havens. second, international tax reform is an essential ingredient in building a fairer tax system. third, it is important to modernize our tax system to better suit a globally integrated economy, reducing the tax preference in favor of foreign operations, and enabling u.s. workers to compete on a level playing field. most important, all our tax system choices must serve the interests of all americans. \n\n fortunately, there are relatively straightforward changes that we can make, that will vastly improve our international tax regime. these include a stronger, more robust minimum tax and steadfast work with our partners and allies abroad in order to counter the pressures of international tax competition. \n\n building a tax system that is fit for purpose \n\n international tax reform is essential to our most important tax policy goals. after the tax cuts of prior years, we now raise only about 16 percent of gdp in federal tax revenue. (to put this into perspective, the last time the u.s. balanced the federal budget, receipts were about 20 percent of gdp.) and, while the pandemic necessitated a large and robust fiscal response in the near term, it will be important to build a tax system that can contribute to our many important fiscal priorities, including lasting investments in infrastructure, research, and clean energy. at the same time, it is essential not to raise taxes on typical workers, who have often not felt the beneficial effects of our strong economic growth. \n\n compared to our trading partners, the u.s. government raises very little corporate tax revenue. for many years, the typical oecd (organization for economic cooperation and development) country has raised about 3 percent of gdp from corporate taxation, whereas in 2018 and 2019 (before the pandemic occurred), the united states raised only 1 percent of gdp from the corporate tax. even before the 2017 tax cuts and jobs act, the united states was below peer nations, collecting only 2 percent of gdp. indeed, corporate taxes as a percentage of gdp have been trending downwards in the united states since the 1950s. [1] \n\n corporate tax revenues relative to gdp \n\n \n\t\t\t \u00a0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t united states \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t oecd average [2] \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t post tcja: 2018/2019 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 1.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 3.1 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t 5 years pre tcja: 2013-2017 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 2.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 2.9 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t \n\t\t\t years prior: 2000-2012 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 2.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t \n\t\t\t 3.0 \n\t\t\t \n\t\t data source: oecd revenue statistics \n\n corporate tax revenues are low despite the fact that u.s. companies produce very high corporate profits, both in historic and comparative terms. for example, in recent years, corporate profits (after-tax) as a share of gdp averaged 9.7 percent (2005-2019), whereas in the period 1980-2000, corporate profits averaged only 5.4 percent of gdp. [3] \n\n indeed, the u.s. corporate sector is the most successful in the world; the united states hosts 37\u00a0percent of the forbes global 2000 top companies\u2019 profits, despite the fact that the united states only comprises 24 percent of world gdp and less than 5 percent of the world\u2019s population. [4] \n\n yet, despite the enormous success of the corporate sector, u.s. companies continue to shift corporate profits offshore, reducing the u.s. corporate tax base and u.s. tax revenues. as of 2017, corporate profit shifting by both u.s. and foreign multinational companies cost the u.s. government approximately $100 billion per year at prior tax rates. [5]  although revenue loss is mechanically lower at today\u2019s lower corporate income tax rates, recent data indicate that the role of foreign tax havens was quite similar in 2018 and 2019 as it was in the years before the 2017 law. \n\n although the 2017 law contained two modest measures that were supposed to reduce profit shifting (the gilti minimum tax, for global intangible low-tax income, and the beat, for base-erosion anti-abuse tax), the 2017 law also encouraged profit shifting in other ways, by exempting from u.s. taxation the first ten percent return on foreign assets, and by taxing foreign profits at half the rate of u.s. profits. \n\n the share of u.s. multinational corporation income in seven big havens, 2000-2019 \n\n \n\n note: data are foreign investment earnings data from the u.s. bureau of economic analysis. the seven low-tax jurisdictions that are particularly important in these data are: bermuda, the caymans, ireland, luxembourg, the netherlands, singapore, and switzerland. the haven share is mechanically higher than it would be in some data sources since the data are reported on an after-tax basis. \n\n based on the early evidence in the two years after the law, the use of tax havens to avoid tax continues unabated. as the figure above illustrates, the share of total foreign income in seven prominent tax havens is nearly identical in the two years after the law (2018 and 2019) as it was in the five year prior to the law, at 61 percent of after-tax income, or 1.5 percent of gdp. \n\n building a fairer tax system \n\n improving international taxation will do more than raise much-needed revenue. it will also improve the progressivity of our tax system, ensuring that large corporations\u2014and those that own them\u2014pay their fair share. \n\n the corporate tax is one of the most progressive taxes in our tax system, far more progressive than the individual income tax or the payroll tax. economic models from organizations as varied as the u.s. treasury, the joint committee on taxation, the congressional budget office, the tax policy center, and the american enterprise institute all agree that the vast majority of the corporate tax burden falls on the owners of capital and those with excess profits. \n\n recent decades have witnessed a worrisome increase in economic inequality, combined with a falling labor share of income. at the same time, governments throughout the world have too often responded by shifting relative burdens away from capital, reducing tax rates on capital gains, dividends, and corporate income, while increasing relative tax burdens on other income. instead of dampening economic inequality, the tax system has too often exacerbated it. in part, these policy changes may have been a response to the fact that capital is more mobile than labor, as it is easier to offshore a factory (and even easier to offshore paper profits) than it is to move a person (or their labor income). \n\n yet policy-makers have not sufficiently modernized the tax system to make it more suited to these global forces. the changes outlined below will go much further toward that end. it is also essential to remember that shifting the capital tax burden to individuals, rather than businesses, will still leave much capital income untaxed, unless long held tax preferences are completely rethought. at present, about 70 percent of u.s. equity income goes untaxed by the u.s. government at the individual level. [6]  (indeed, some u.s. equities are also held by foreigners, whose residence countries may or may not tax that income at home. when corporate rates are cut, large benefits accrue to foreign investors.) \n\n in addition to enhancing the progressivity of the u.s. tax system, the corporate tax is also efficient, since taxing excess profits can generate revenue without undue distortion, and evidence indicates that a rising share of the tax base, now likely over three quarters, is comprised of excess returns. [7]  finally, a majority of voters in both parties favor higher taxes on corporations. [8] \n\n building an economy that meets the needs of all americans \n\n our modern global economy generates enormous churn. forces such as transformative technological change, rising market power, import competition, declining unionization, and changing social norms have left many workers with economic outcomes that fall short of long-held expectations. nearly 90 percent of children born in the 1940s out-earned their parents, but that share has fallen steadily. for children born in 1970, only 60 percent out-earn their parents; for those born in the 1980s, only half do. [9] \n\n those left behind by economic disruption are looking for answers. some policy solutions, such as reinvigorating labor law to give workers greater economic power and investing in infrastructure and community colleges in left-behind regions, can be quite helpful. others, such as erecting immigration barriers, risk adding insult to injury. immigration is a vital source of job creation and innovation in the u.s. economy; turning our back on immigrants and foreign students weakens one of our most essential advantages. [10] \n\n yet we can do a lot more to ensure our tax system works for american workers. expanding the earned income tax credit rewards work for those that are struggling, and expanding the child tax credit is an enormous anti-poverty tool. both of these were enacted as part of the american rescue plan. in corporate tax, it is important to reduce the large tilt in the playing field that favors foreign income and to work with partner countries to lessen the pressures of tax competition. a stronger minimum tax, stronger measures to tackle the profit shifting of foreign multinational companies, and close cooperation with our allies all have an important role to play. \n\n building a 21st century tax system \n\n the american rescue plan provided an essential down payment, expanding child tax credits and earned income tax credits, both measures that go to the heart of creating inclusive, worker-focused prosperity. but we also need to build business tax systems that can handle the global mobility of capital. \n\n multinational corporations can reasonably be asked to pay their fair share. at present, u.s. corporations pay income tax at only a 21 percent rate, a lower marginal tax rate than that faced by many schoolteachers and firefighters. [11]  multinational companies operating offshore receive even more favorable tax treatment. under the gilti minimum tax, the first ten percent return on tangible assets is completely free of u.s. tax, and subsequent income is taxed with a 50 percent deduction, facing tax at approximately half the full u.s. rate. [12]  our tax system would benefit from a much stronger minimum tax. \n\n building multilateral cooperation in international tax \n\n we are not alone in worrying about the profit shifting of multinational companies. since 2013, there has been an ongoing international effort at cooperation in this area, led by the oecd and g20 countries, referred to as beps (for base erosion and profit shifting). the first round of negotiations made some modest progress in several areas, but ultimately was not transformational, as tax avoidance techniques that were shut down sprung back in different forms, and multinational company profit shifting continued in a manner similar to years prior. \n\n presently, a second round of negotiations is centered around addressing two problems: rethinking the allocation of taxing rights in a modern economy (so called \u201cpillar one\u201d), and ensuring that all companies pay some minimum level of tax (\u201cpillar two\u201d). within these efforts, a country-by-country minimum tax is presently being proposed internationally. \n\n in general, there is strong policy interest in solving these vexing international tax problems, and countries\u2019 efforts can be mutually reinforcing. for instance, governments levying minimum taxes generate positive fiscal spillovers for each other\u2019s tax bases, by substantially reducing the incentive of their resident multinational companies to shift profits away from all non-haven tax bases toward tax havens. further, u.s. leadership in international tax reform may incentivize stronger action abroad. \n\n working with our allies and friends in order to build better tax laws can help nations cooperate to solve other global collective action problems, not just stopping excessive tax competition pressures in corporate tax, but also using these vital international collaborations to work productively to handle issues like climate change, global public health, and other serious threats. \n\n building consensus \n\n several hurdles stand in the way of international reforms, but they are not insurmountable. \n\n concerns about the competitiveness of u.s. multinationals ignore the evidence. both before and after the 2017 tax act, u.s. multinational companies are the envy of the world, not just for their high profits and market capitalization, but also for their tax planning acumen. u.s. multinational companies paid similar effective tax rates as peers in other countries, even before the 2017 tax law dramatically lowered u.s. corporate tax rates. and, u.s. corporate tax revenues are far lower than those in peer countries, as shown in the table above. \n\n further, to the extent that foreign countries also adopt strong minimum taxes, that will also reduce any competitiveness worries, while protecting our tax base from the profit shifting of foreign multinational companies. in fact, the present moment is an ideal time to reform our international tax rules, since there is a strong international consensus around addressing these problems, and our action can encourage action abroad. \n\n finally, it is important to remember that competitiveness is about more than the success of u.s. companies in foreign merger and acquisition bids. it is also about ensuring that our tax code doesn\u2019t incentivize foreign operations at the expense of those at home. and, it is about nurturing the many fundamental strengths that make the united states a good place to do business. investing in our institutions, in the abilities, education, and economic power of american workers, in the quality of our infrastructure, and in cutting-edge research is all important. it is also important to work harmoniously with other countries in order to ensure a smooth and stable trading system, and in order to seriously address common concerns such as climate change and public health.\u00a0 \n\n \u00a0\n [1]  data from tax policy center. \u201ccorporate income tax as a share of gdp, 1956-2018.\u201d https://www.taxpolicycenter.org/statistics/corporate-income-tax-share-gdp-1946-2018 \n\n [2]  the average for g7 countries is very similar. \n\n [3]  data are from the federal reserve economics statistics database. \n\n [4]  data are from 2020 forbes global 2000 list. \n\n [5]  see clausing, kimberly. \u201cprofit shifting before and after the tax cuts and jobs act.\u201d 2020.  national tax journal .73(4). 1233-1266. my preferred estimate is over $100 billion, but a thorough analysis that employs four data sources and three methods finds a wide range of revenue costs;

{"header": "testimony of secretary of the treasury janet l. yellen, before the committee on banking, housing, & urban affairs, u. s. senate", "date": "2021-03-24t00:49:35z", "text": "chairman brown, ranking member toomey, members of the committee, thank you for having me. \n\n we are meeting at a hopeful moment for the economy \u2013 but still a daunting one. while we\u2019re seeing signs of recovery, we should be clear-eyed about the hole we\u2019re digging out of: the country is still down nearly 10 million jobs from its pre-pandemic peak. \n\n when congress passed the cares and consolidated appropriations acts last year, it gave the federal government some powerful tools to address the crisis. but upon taking office, i worried they weren\u2019t powerful enough. after all, there were \u2013 and still are \u2013 some very deep pockets of pain in the data. \n\n one-in-ten homeowners with a mortgage are behind on their payments, and almost one-in-five renters are behind on their rent. there are 22 million people who say they don\u2019t have enough food to eat. one-in-ten adults are hungry in america. \n\n i looked at data like these, and i worried that the covid economy was going to keep hurting millions of people now and haunt them long after the health emergency was over. \n\n we know that when the foundations of someone\u2019s life fall apart \u2013 when they lose the roof over their head or the ability to eat dinner every night \u2013 the pain can weigh on them for years. their earning potential is permanently lowered. \u00a0i worried about this happening on a mass scale. \n\n that\u2019s why i advocated very hard for the american rescue plan, and it\u2019s why my first \u2013 and most enthusiastic \u2013 message today is: thank you. \n\n with the passage of the rescue plan, i am confident that people will reach the other side of this pandemic with the foundations of their lives intact. and i believe they will be met there by a growing economy. in fact, i think we may see a return to full employment next year. \n\n of course, the speed and strength of our recovery depends, in part, on how we implement the legislation. treasury is tasked with much of that work, and there is nothing that i \u2013 or my team \u2013 take more seriously. we appreciate your oversight on this matter, and i want to briefly tell you about how we\u2019ve been working. \u00a0 \n\n since taking office two months ago, we have been expediting relief to the areas of greatest need. for example, small businesses \u2013 and especially the smallest small businesses, which are disproportionally owned by women and people of color. \n\n the pandemic has hit these businesses hard. the paycheck protection program was an early lifeline, but because of issues with the program\u2019s design, the first rounds often didn\u2019t reach the smallest sole proprietorships. we\u2019re addressing that now. we worked with sba to tweak how the program was implemented. it\u2019s allowing the ppp to reach millions more microbusinesses and entrepreneurs, especially in rural and low-income areas. \n\n we\u2019re also building capacity to support these communities over the longer term. because of the december legislation, treasury now has $12 billion to inject into community development financial institutions and minority depository institutions. in turn, these cdfis and mdis can lend that capital out, helping people buy homes and start businesses in places that the financial services sector traditionally hasn\u2019t served well. \u00a0 \n\n then, there are the families i spoke about, the ones struggling to keep a roof over their head and food on the table. \n\n the american rescue plan provides more than $30 billion to help renters and homeowners at risk of losing their homes. and we\u2019re making sure that assistance flows as efficiently as possible. \n\n for instance, the previous administration put in place rules that required tenants and landlords to provide quite a bit of documentation to get rental assistance, including detailed statements about their income. but some people don\u2019t have access to those documents. we\u2019re cutting through the red tape for them, while still taking reasonable steps to prevent fraud and abuse. \n\n and of course, we\u2019ve been sending direct payments to americans \u2013 a lot of americans. as of last week, we had issued over 90 million payments.\u00a0 \n\n and all this is just a fraction of treasury\u2019s work. there are so many more relief programs, including one that will provide $350 billion in aid to state and local governments. implementing all of it is more complicated than it sounds, and we are working closely with stakeholders to make sure that these programs are both efficient and effective. \n\n behind these many relief programs, these millions of transactions, are a staff of very dedicated (and very tired) treasury and irs employees. my final word is to them: thank you. you are putting on a master class in how government should work in the furnace of a crisis. i\u2019m grateful to be your colleague. \n\n with that, i am happy to answer any questions you have. \n\n view: yellen sbhc oversight hearing written testimony & addendum"},

this sum includes, but is not limited to, fees to procure fraudulent or counterfeit documents, make payoffs to corrupt officials, secure lodging along smuggling route, and provide payments to facilitators in various countries. \u00a0abid ali khan tco often provides travelers with fraudulently obtained passports from different countries to facilitate his clients\u2019 global movement and smuggling to the united states. \u00a0the abid ali khan tco frequently utilizes a common route of travel that begins in pakistan or afghanistan, transiting through certain south and central american countries before arriving at the southern border of the united states. \n\n ofac is also designating three khan associates for having materially assisted, sponsored, or provided financial, material, or technological support for, or goods or services to or in support of, or for having acted or having purported to act for or on behalf of, directly or indirectly, the abid ali khan tco. \u00a0afghan national redi hussein khal gul serves as khan\u2019s secretary, performing functions that include, but are not limited to, initial contact with clients, travel facilitation, and obtaining fraudulent documents for the migrants. \u00a0pakistani national shakeel karim is an employee of khan and uses friends travel inn pvt ltd to coordinate travel for migrants. \u00a0pakistani national mohammed choudry ikram waraich serves as khan\u2019s contact in the middle east and facilitates travel into the united states. \u00a0all three individuals are linked to the procurement or use of fraudulent documents for travel or asylum applications, which can significantly impair appropriate immigration vetting processes. \n\n in addition to the national security concerns, the practice of smuggling-for-profit and the facilitation of fraudulent documentation undermines the credibility of the u.s. asylum system, damaging public confidence in the vetting process, and jeopardizing access to protection for vulnerable persons fleeing conflict, famine, and persecution. \n\n as a result of today\u2019s action, all assets of abid ali khan the abid ali khan tco, and the three individuals named above, that are in the united states or in the possession or control of u.s. persons must be blocked and reported to ofac. \u00a0ofac\u2019s regulations generally prohibit all dealings by u.s. persons or within (or transiting) the united states that involve any property or interests in property of abid ali khan, the abid ali khan tco, or any other blocked or designated persons. \n\n view more information on the persons designated today. \n\n view the human smuggling network chart on the individuals designated today . \n\n \u00a0 \n\n ###"},

{"header": "joint imfc and development committee statement by treasury secretary janet l. yellen", "date": "2021-04-08t12:00:00z", "text": "as we come together virtually this week, the challenges we face are historic. most immediately is the continuing covid-19 pandemic, which has inflicted tragic loss of life and an economic crisis. the crisis has exacerbated the trend of rising income inequality, raising concerns about a divergent path within and across countries. we also face the existential threat of climate change. we can only resolve these problems through strong international cooperation. the biden-harris administration is committed to working with our partners, including the international monetary fund (imf) and world bank group (wbg), to help the world emerge from this crisis, and set the stage for more inclusive, resilient, and sustainable growth going forward. \n\n the first order of importance is putting an end to the health crisis, which is a prerequisite to a robust economic recovery. accordingly, the united states is making substantial progress in vaccinating our own population. and importantly we will work with partners to find global solutions to vaccinating the rest of the world. the united states has committed $4 billion to covax to help finance vaccine access globally, and i urge others to increase their support for this initiative. the united states will continue to work with partners to increase vaccine supplies, explore sharing excess vaccines, and make sure financing does not become an obstacle for global vaccination. the wbg will continue to be integral in securing access to vaccines for low-income and developing countries. i urge the wbg to use its leadership and convening roles to support timely access, particularly for the poorest countries, including through collaboration with covax, and to work toward ensuring robust, equitable, and transparent vaccination deployment. i also urge the wbg and shareholder governments to help overcome challenges to increase vaccine manufacturing capacity. \n\n beyond the tragic human toll, covid-19 has also created an economic crisis. the global economic outlook has improved significantly from a year ago with substantial fiscal and monetary support from major economies. but, the job is not yet done given high uncertainty and the risk of permanent scarring. i urge major economies to not just avoid removing support too early, but to strive to provide significant amounts of new fiscal support to secure a robust recovery. to that end, the united states is implementing the $1.9 trillion american rescue plan (arp), which provides support to families, small businesses, and local communities. the arp\u2019s passage has contributed to significant upward revisions in u.s. and global growth forecasts. the united states could reach full employment as soon as next year. going forward, president biden has outlined another fiscal package to \u201cbuild back better\u201d by focusing on infrastructure across many areas that are partly aimed to make progress on issues like climate change and inequality. \n\n with limited policy options and longstanding structural challenges, many developing countries have not been able to support their economies through the crisis. without significant action, we could face a permanent divergence in the global economy. the imf and wbg have provided much-needed emergency support to stem the immediate crisis impacts. they must continue to work closely to finance and support members\u2019 policy efforts, so their actions complement each other and underpin the international response. as we move past the initial emergency phase, i urge countries to work with the imf and wbg to develop macroeconomic and structural reform agendas, and to seek full-fledged imf programs where necessary. to provide support alongside these efforts, the united states supports enhancing concessional lending at the imf and wbg, alongside g20 debt relief initiatives, and pursuing an sdr allocation. \n\n i applaud the imf\u2019s stepped-up deployment of resources that have created space for countries in need to fight the twin health and economic crises. for low-income countries, the poverty reduction and growth trust (prgt) has provided substantial financing to support crisis responses, with lending last year surpassing that of the previous 10 years combined. however, low-income countries face rising needs in the coming years. i welcome efforts to ensure that prgt lending facilities can support low-income countries\u2019 needs over the medium term, and that imf members agree on a robust financing strategy in support of the prgt. as countries get past the initial crisis phase, the imf\u2019s robust surveillance work will be as important as ever to help countries plan for the recovery and monitor financial stability risks. \n\n the imf can also play a major role in providing support through an sdr allocation that will give a much-needed boost to global reserves. the united states supports pursuing a $650 billion sdr allocation given the global reserve need and to help provide space to fight the health and economic crises. it will be critical that any such allocation comes alongside efforts to enhance transparency and accountability around sdrs, which will give the public insight into how authorities use sdrs and help to ensure sdrs are used to restore economic stability. imf members should also work to explore ways for major economies to reallocate sdrs to amplify support for low-income countries, for example by lending sdrs to the prgt. \n\n the unprecedented nature of covid-19 has dramatically increased demand for wbg financing, particularly among the poorest countries. the united states supports the accelerated negotiation of the 20th international development association (ida) replenishment to meet this demand. additional resources will help sustain grant and concessional finance to the most vulnerable countries to support a durable recovery and consolidate development gains. even as we move forward with that effort, it is important to stay focused on making full use of ida\u2019s available resources and targeting them where they are needed most. i also welcome opportunities to expand and strengthen important policy work in the negotiations, particularly in areas such as climate, inclusion, resilience, and debt management and transparency. \n\n judicious management of wbg finances remains a focus, particularly during this era of high demands and stretched balance sheets. the international bank for reconstruction and development (ibrd) has met this demand head-on, stretching its financing capacity by using tools created from the reforms that came as part of the 2018 capital package. the robust response from the ibrd and the international financial corporation to the pandemic highlights the continued value of the 2018 capital package and need to follow through on reforms to enhance efficiency and program resources as impactfully as possible. this includes continued progress in allocating resources towards poorer countries and focusing activities and limited resources on addressing constraints to graduation in wealthier countries with strong access to other financing sources. i urge the wbg and shareholders to focus on continued implementation of this package of reforms and to conclude the 2020 ibrd and ifc shareholding reviews. \n\n covid-19 has further exposed debt vulnerabilities among low-income countries as fiscal needs rose while revenues plummeted amid the economic collapse. the debt service suspension initiative (dssi) has provided liquidity relief to help in the fight. but that relief is only temporary, and many countries may need deeper debt treatment. therefore, the united states supports a final dssi extension and strongly urges countries to quickly move beyond it to what we view as a critical tool for support to low-income countries, the g20 common framework. \n\n going forward, the common framework provides a venue for countries to address prolonged liquidity problems and debt sustainability. common framework treatment requires beneficiary countries to finalize a full-fledged imf program\u2014to guide credible policy reforms\u2014and enables fair burden-sharing from all official bilateral and private creditors through the comparability of treatment principle. we strongly urge all creditors to fully and transparently implement the common framework to avoid unnecessary delays that can prolong debt overhangs and exacerbate growth shocks. we welcome strong coordination and support from the imf and wbg, while adhering to their respective mandates, to help this creditor-led process succeed. \n\n even with a full-time focus on the crisis response, we must not delay in addressing two of the greatest threats to our economies and societies\u2014climate change and inequality. \n\n the united states is fully committed to working with international partners to tackle climate change. president biden has rejoined the paris agreement and has released a detailed plan to address the issue, including aligning financial flows with the paris agreement in coordination with international partners, investing in sustainable infrastructure, and creating green jobs. we also believe major economies should support developing countries to pursue economic growth in a green and sustainable way. and the imf and wbg have key roles to play. \n\n i ask the wbg to lead on transformative climate investments, develop tools to catalyze co-financing, and help countries manage risks and reduce emissions. this includes assistance for developing countries to increase the ambition of their adaptation and climate resilience plans in line with paris agreement goals. we also expect the wbg to partner with the green climate fund and the climate investment funds, which are important tools to meet these goals. i welcome the wbg\u2019s recent announcement that it will increase its climate co-financing target to 35 percent and that 50 percent of this will focus on adaptation. we also encourage the wbg to continue to set an aggressive agenda on climate and the green recovery, using its updated climate change action plan to further enhance climate action support. \n\n we strongly support the imf expanding its climate work within its mandate, including through macroeconomic surveillance, financial sector analysis, capacity development, and data provision. the imf has a critical role in analyzing the macroeconomic and financial sector implications of climate change adaptation and global greenhouse gas emission mitigation efforts by countries. \n\n finally, this crisis has exacerbated inequality both within and across countries. the biden-harris administration is committed to make our economy more inclusive and address long-standing income and racial inequities. i am concerned that an uneven recovery will result in a divergent growth path across countries. i welcome work underway at the imf and wbg to tackle inequality to support inclusion and expect both institutions to be crucial partners in this fight across the globe. \n\n ###"},

and the bureau of the fiscal service announced they are disbursing more than 25 million payments in the fourth batch of economic impact payments from the american rescue plan. \n\n today\u2019s announcement brings the total disbursed so far to more than 156 million payments, with a total value of approximately $372 billion, since these payments began rolling out to americans in batches, as  announced  on march 12.\u00a0 \n\n the fourth batch of payments began processing on friday, april 2, with an official payment date of april 7, with some people receiving direct payments in their accounts earlier as provisional or pending deposits. here is additional information on this batch of payments: \n\n in total, this batch includes more than 25 million payments, with a total value of more than $36 billion. \n\t the largest block of these payments went to social security beneficiaries who didn\u2019t file a 2020 or 2019 tax return and didn\u2019t use the non-filers tool last year. more than 19 million payments, with a total value of more than $26 billion, went to these beneficiaries, which include social security retirement, survivor or disability (ssdi) beneficiaries. \n\t more than 3 million payments, with a total value of nearly $5 billion, went to supplemental security income (ssi) beneficiaries. \n\t nearly 85,000 payments, with a total value of more than $119 million, went to railroad retirement board (rrb) beneficiaries. \n\t this batch includes additional ongoing supplemental payments for people who earlier in march received payments based on their 2019 tax returns but are eligible for a new or larger payment based on their recently processed 2020 tax returns. this batch included more than 1 million of these \u201cplus-up\u201d payments, with a total value of more than $2 billion. \n\t more than 1 million payments, with a total value of nearly $3 billion, went to people for whom the irs previously did not have information to issue a payment but who recently filed a tax return and qualified for an economic impact payment.\u00a0 payments to this group -- and the \u201cplus-up\u201d payments noted above -- will continue on a weekly basis going forward as the irs continues processing tax returns from 2020 and 2019. \n\t overall, this fourth batch of payments contains nearly 24 million direct deposit payments (with a total value of over $33 billion) and more than 1 million paper check payments (with a total value of nearly $3 billion). additional\u00a0 information is available on the first three batches of economic impact payments from the american rescue plan, which began processing on  march 26 ,  march 19 , and  march 12 . \n\n no action is needed by most people to obtain this round of economic impact payments. people can check the  get my payment  tool on irs.gov on to see if the their payment has been scheduled. \n\n payments to non-filer va beneficiaries will be disbursed on april 14 \n\n the irs continues to review data received from veterans affairs (va), which covers veterans and their beneficiaries who receive compensation and pension (c&p) benefit payments who don\u2019t normally file a tax return. \n\n if no additional issues arise, the irs expects to begin processing these va payment files at the end of this week. because the majority of these payments will be disbursed electronically, they would be received on the official payment date of april 14. the irs projects va beneficiary payment information would be available in the get my payment tool this weekend, april 10-11. \n\n payments continue to be made rapidly and effectively \n\n the irs and treasury are disbursing economic impact payments authorized by the american rescue plan quickly and successfully, while improving on previous rounds of payments. \n\n within two weeks of the american rescue plan becoming law, the irs and treasury had started disbursing 127 million payments, including 107 million completed direct deposits. at a similar point during the first round of economic impact payments authorized a year ago, the first payments had yet to be completed. \n\t payments to social security and other federal beneficiaries are being issued faster than they were during the first round of payments a year ago. \n\t approximately 85% of the current round of payments have been made by direct deposit, up from 74% in the first round of payments and 77% in the second round.\u00a0 this helps to expedite payments for millions of american families.\u00a0 \n\t direct deposits are also more likely to be successfully delivered than mailed payments, and the return rate of direct deposits is also lower than in previous rounds of payments. \n\t over 3.1 million direct express cardholders have received payment electronically, more than a half-million more than in previous rounds.\u00a0 making most of these payments to direct express cards enables cardholders, many of whom are unbanked, to receive their economic impact payment the same way they typically receive their federal benefits. special reminder for those who don't normally file a tax return \n\n some federal benefits recipients may need to file a 2020 tax return, even if they don't usually file, to provide information the irs needs to send payments for a qualified dependent. eligible individuals in this group should file a 2020 tax return to be considered for an additional payment for their qualified dependent as quickly as possible. \n\n people who don't normally file a tax return and don't receive federal benefits may qualify for these economic impact payments. this includes those experiencing homelessness, the rural poor, and others. individuals who didn't get a first or second round economic impact payment or got less than the full amounts may be eligible for the  2020 recovery rebate credit , but they\u2019ll need to file a 2020 tax return. see the special section on irs.gov:  claiming the 2020 recovery rebate credit if you aren't required to file a tax return. \n\n free  tax return preparation  is available for qualifying people. \n\n the irs reminds taxpayers that the income levels in this new round of economic impact payments have changed. this means that some people won't be eligible for the third payment even if they received a first or second economic impact payment or claimed a 2020 recovery rebate credit. payments will begin to be reduced for individuals making $75,000 or above in adjusted gross income ($150,000 for married filing jointly). the payments end at $80,000 for individuals ($160,000 for married filing jointly); people with adjusted gross incomes above these levels are ineligible for a payment. \n\n individuals can check the  get my payment  tool on irs.gov to see the payment
